Updates since v1.7.0
--------------------

 * Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that interactively ask
   password can be told to use an external program given via GIT_ASKPASS.

 * "git am" learned "--keep-cr" option to handle inputs that are
   mixture of changes to files with and without CRLF line endings.
