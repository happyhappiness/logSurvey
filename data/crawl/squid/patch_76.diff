+<sect1>Helper Binary Changes
 <p>The <em>basic_msnt_multi_domain_auth</em> helper has been removed. The
    <em>basic_smb_lm_auth</em> helper performs the same actions without extra
    Perl and Samba dependencies.
 
+<p>The <em>cert_valid.pl</em> testing helper has been renamed to
+   <em>security_fake_certverify</em>, reflecting the Squid helper naming schema
+   and that it does not actually perform any certificate checks.
+
+<p>The <em>security_fake_certverify</em> helper is also now built and installed
+   by default. It is written in Perl so does not require OpenSSL dependencies
+   for installation. But does use the Perl Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 module for execution.
+   Building the helper can be controlled using the <em>--enable-security-cert-validators="fake"</em>
+   option.
+
+<p>The <em>ssl_crtd</em> helper has been renamed to <em>security_file_certgen</em>
+   and is now built and installed by default whenever OpenSSL support is enabled.
+   Building the helper can be controlled using the <em>--enable-security-cert-generators="file"</em>
+   option.
+   NOTE: The <em>--enable-ssl-crtd</em> option is still required to enable the
+   <em>sslcrtd_program</em> helper interface within Squid that uses the helper.
+
+<p>The <em>ntlm_smb_lm_auth</em> helper is now built using <em>--enable-auth-ntlm="SMB_LM"</em>.

+<sect1>Improved process management
+<p>Squid is traditionally refered to as a daemon. But is actually a combination
+   of daemon and daemon manager processes. This has caused significant problems
+   integrating it with other third-party daemon managers.
+
+<p>The Squid process which places its PID into the squid.pid file has always
+   been the process to which control signals are sent. The manager process is
+   now taking on signal handling instead of the main daemon process. Enabling
+   integration with daemon managers such as Upstart or systemd which assume the
+   process they initiated is the daemon with a PID to control.
+
+<p>The squid binary now has a new <em>--foreground</em> command line option
+   which prevents the process from exiting early while background workers
+   continue their processing. When run with this option Squid will now wait
+   for the worker(s) to finish before exiting. Unlike the old <em>-N</em> option
+   <em>--foreground</em> supports SMP workers and multi-process features.
+   <em>--foreground</em> is particularly useful for use with <em>-z</em> (disk
+   cache structures creation), as it allows the caller to wait until Squid has
+   finished.
