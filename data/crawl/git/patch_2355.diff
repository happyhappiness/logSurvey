+Note about fast-forwards
+------------------------
+
+When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to
+point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
+fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.
+
+In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the original
+commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new commit B
+builds on top of.  Hence, it does not lose any history.
+
+In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history.  For example,
+suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you built
+a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history
+leading to commit A.  The history looks like this:
+
+----------------
+
+      B
+     /
+ ---X---A
+
+----------------
+
+Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to A
+back to the original repository you two obtained the original commit X.
+
+The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point at
+commit X to point at commit A.  It is a fast-forward.
+
+But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that
+now points at A) with commit B.  This does _not_ fast-forward.  If you did
+so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody
+will now start building on top of B.
+
+The command by default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward
+to prevent such loss of history.
+
+If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) nor the work by
+the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first fetch the
+history from the repository, create a history that contains changes done
+by both parties, and push the result back.
+
+You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push"
+the result.  A "git pull" will create a merge commit C between commits A
+and B.
+
+----------------
+
+      B---C
+     /   /
+ ---X---A
+
+----------------
+
+Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your
+push will be accepted.
+
+Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A,
+with "git pull --rebase", and push the result back.  The rebase will
+create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of
+A.
+
+----------------
+
+      B   D
+     /   /
+ ---X---A
+
+----------------
+
+Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be
+accepted.
+
+There is another common situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward
+rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even when you are
+pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit
+A yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it with "git
+commit --amend" to produce commit B, and you try to push it out, because
+forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if
+you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A
+(and started building on top of it), you can run "git push --force" to
+overwrite it. In other words, "git push --force" is a method reserved for
+a case where you do mean to lose history.
