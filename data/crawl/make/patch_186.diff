-Notes on the Free Translation Project
-*************************************
-
-   Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project
-is a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
-together, so that will gradually become able to speak many languages.
-A few packages already provide translations for their messages.
-
-   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
-assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
-itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do *not*
-need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
-this package with messages translated.
-
-   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
-explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
-available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
-work at translations should contact the appropriate team.
-
-   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
-related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
-`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
-`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
-
-One advise in advance
-=====================
-
-   If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
-should configure it using
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
-package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
-operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
-the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
-many features (such as locale alias or message inheritance) as the
-implementation here.  It is also not possible to offer this additional
-functionality on top of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of
-GNU `gettext' will very likely convey even more functionality.  So it
-might be a good idea to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
-
-   So you need not provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
-you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
-included `libintl'.
-
-INSTALL Matters
-===============
-
-   Some packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the
-programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
-Most such packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own
-ways to internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
-
-   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
-messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system provides
-usable `catgets' (if using this is selected by the installer) or
-`gettext' functions.  If neither is available, the GNU `gettext' own
-library will be used.  This library is wholly contained within this
-package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior installation of
-the GNU `gettext' package is *not* required.  Installers may use
-special options at configuration time for changing the default
-behaviour.  The commands:
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-     ./configure --with-catgets
-     ./configure --disable-nls
-
-will respectively bypass any pre-existing `catgets' or `gettext' to use
-the internationalizing routines provided within this package, enable
-the use of the `catgets' functions (if found on the locale system), or
-else, *totally* disable translation of messages.
-
-   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
-configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
-probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
-will decide to use this.  This might be not what is desirable.  You
-should use the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e.
-if the file `intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this
-package is more recent, you should use
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to prevent auto-detection.
-
-   By default the configuration process will not test for the `catgets'
-function and therefore they will not be used.  The reasons are already
-given above: the emulation on top of `catgets' cannot provide all the
-extensions provided by the GNU `gettext' library.  If you nevertheless
-want to use the `catgets' functions use
-
-     ./configure --with-catgets
-
-to enable the test for `catgets' (this causes no harm if `catgets' is
-not available on your system).  If you really select this option we
-would like to hear about the reasons because we cannot think of any
-good one ourself.
-
-   Internationalized packages have usually many `po/LL.po' files, where
-LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
-translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
-`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
-together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
-may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
-`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
-codes, stating which languages are allowed.
-
-Using This Package
-==================
-
-   As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
-only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
-ISO 639 `LL' two-letter code prior to using the programs in the
-package.  For example, let's suppose that you speak German.  At the
-shell prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de' (in `csh'),
-`export LANG; LANG=de' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de' (in `bash').  This
-can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for all.
-
-   An operating system might already offer message localization for
-many of its programs, while other programs have been installed locally
-with the full capabilities of GNU `gettext'.  Just using `gettext'
-extended syntax for `LANG' would break proper localization of already
-available operating system programs.  In this case, users should set
-both `LANGUAGE' and `LANG' variables in their environment, as programs
-using GNU `gettext' give preference to `LANGUAGE'.  For example, some
-Swedish users would rather read translations in German than English for
-when Swedish is not available.  This is easily accomplished by setting
-`LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv'.
-
-Translating Teams
-=================
-
-   For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
-people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
-able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
-Each translation team has its own mailing list, courtesy of Linux
-International.  You may reach your translation team at the address
-`LL@li.org', replacing LL by the two-letter ISO 639 code for your
-language.  Language codes are *not* the same as the country codes given
-in ISO 3166.  The following translation teams exist, as of December
-1997:
-
-     Chinese `zh', Czech `cs', Danish `da', Dutch `nl', English `en',
-     Esperanto `eo', Finnish `fi', French `fr', German `de', Hungarian
-     `hu', Irish `ga', Italian `it', Indonesian `id', Japanese `ja',
-     Korean `ko', Latin `la', Norwegian `no', Persian `fa', Polish
-     `pl', Portuguese `pt', Russian `ru', Slovenian `sl', Spanish `es',
-     Swedish `sv', and Turkish `tr'.
-
-For example, you may reach the Chinese translation team by writing to
-`zh@li.org'.
-
-   If you'd like to volunteer to *work* at translating messages, you
-should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
-The subscribing address is *not* the same as the list itself, it has
-`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
-message to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:
-
-     subscribe
-
-   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
-*actively* in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
-rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
-you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
-get started, please write to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to reach the
-coordinator for all translator teams.
-
-   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
-the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more than
-programming skill, here.
-
-Available Packages

-
-   Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
-matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of December
-1997.  The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages
-PO files have been submitted to translation coordination.

-   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
-visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
-used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
-dialects.
-
-   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
-which it applies should also have been internationalized and
-distributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable
-lag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a
-distribution.
