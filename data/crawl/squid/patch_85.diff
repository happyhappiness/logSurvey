 <sect1>Improved SMP support
 <p>Use of C++11 atomic operations instead of GNU atomics allows a wider range of
    operating systems and compilers to build Squid SMP and multi-process features.

+<sect1>Improved process management
+<p>Squid is traditionally refered to as a daemon. But is actually a combination
+   of daemon and daemon manager processes. This has caused significant problems
+   integrating it with other third-party daemon managers.
+
+<p>The Squid process which places its PID into the squid.pid file has always
+   been the process to which control signals are sent. The manager process is
+   now taking on signal handling instead of the main daemon process. Enabling
+   integration with daemon managers such as Upstart or systemd which assume the
+   process they initiated is the daemon with a PID to control.
+
+<p>The squid binary now has a new <em>--foreground</em> command line option
+   which prevents the process from exiting early while background workers
+   continue their processing. When run with this option Squid will now wait
+   for the worker(s) to finish before exiting. Unlike the old <em>-N</em> option
+   <em>--foreground</em> supports SMP workers and multi-process features.
+   <em>--foreground</em> is particularly useful for use with <em>-z</em> (disk
+   cache structures creation), as it allows the caller to wait until Squid has
+   finished.
