-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-		       Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Program or works based on it.
-
-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-Foundation.
-
-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
-when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
-Public License instead of this License.

-CppUnit's coding guidelines for portability:
---------------------------------------------
-
-- don't explicitly declare CppUnit namespace, instead use macro
-  CPPUNIT_NS_BEGIN and CPPUNIT_NS_END.
-
-- don't explicitly use 'CppUnit' to refer to class in CppUnit namespace,
-  instead use macro CPPUNIT_NS which expands to either 'CppUnit' or 
-  nothing depending on the configuration.
-
-- don't use the 'using directive', always use full qualification. For STL,
-  always use std::.
-
-- don't use C++ style cast directly, instead use CppUnit's cast macro
-  (CPPUNIT_CONST_CAST).
-
-- don't use the mutable keyword, instead do a const cast.
-
-- don't use the typename keyword in template declaration, instead use 'class'.
-
-- don't make use of RTTI (typeid) or dynamic_cast mandatory.
-
-- don't use STL container directly, instead use CppUnit's wrapper located
-  in include/cppunit/portability. This help support compilers that don't 
-  support default template parameter and require an allocator to be 
-  specified.
-
-- don't use default template parameters. If needed, use STLPort wrapper
-  technic (see include/cppunit/portability/).
-
-- don't use templatized member functions (template method declared inside a
-  class), instead declares them as simple template functions (even
-  mainstream compiler such as VC++ 6 as trouble with them).
-
-- don't use default parameter value in template function. Not supported
-  by all compiler (on OS/390 for instance).
-
-- don't use STL container at() method, instead use the array accessor [].
-  at() is not supported on some gcc versions.
-
-- dereferencing containers must be done by (*ref_ptr).data instead of
-  ref_ptr->data.
-
-In brief, it should be possible to compile CppUnit on a C++ compiler that do
-not have the following features:
-- C++ style cast
-- mutable and typename keyword
-- RTTI
-- template default parameters
-- templatized member functions (that is a template function declared within a
-  class).
-- namespace
-
-As such, usage of those features should always be optional.
-
-Following those guidelines should allow to compile on most compilers, as long
-as STL are available (in std namespace or not), with some form of strstream and
-iostream, as well as exception support.

-Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software
-Foundation, Inc.
-
-   This file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives
-unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.
-
-Basic Installation
-==================
-
-   These are generic installation instructions.
-
-   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
-file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
-debugging `configure').
-
-   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
-and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
-the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
-disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
-cache files.)
-
-   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
-some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
-may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
-`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
-`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
-a newer version of `autoconf'.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
-     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
-     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
-     `configure' itself.
-
-     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
-     messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package.
-
-  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
-     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
-     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
-     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
-     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
-     with the distribution.
-
-Compilers and Options
-=====================
-
-   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
-for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
-
-   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
-by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
-is an example:
-
-     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
-
-   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
-
-Compiling For Multiple Architectures
-====================================
-
-   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
-same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
-supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
-directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
-
-   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
-time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
-package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
-for another architecture.
-
-Installation Names
-==================
-
-   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
-`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
-option `--prefix=PATH'.
-
-   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
-architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
-
-   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
-option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
-
-Optional Features
-=================
-
-   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
-`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
-is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
-`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
-package recognizes.
-
-   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
-find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
-you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
-`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
-
-Specifying the System Type
-==========================
-
-   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
-automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
-will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
-_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
-a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
-`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
-
-     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
-
-where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
-
-     OS KERNEL-OS
-
-   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
-`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
-need to know the machine type.
-
-   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
-use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
-produce code for.
-
-   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
-platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
-"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
-eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
-
-Sharing Defaults
-================
-
-   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
-you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
-default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
-`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
-`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
-
-Defining Variables
-==================
-
-   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
-environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
-configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
-variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
-them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
-
-     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
-
-will cause the specified gcc to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
-overridden in the site shell script).
-
-`configure' Invocation
-======================
-
-   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
-operates.
-
-`--help'
-`-h'
-     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
-
-`--version'
-`-V'
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
-     script, and exit.
-
-`--cache-file=FILE'
-     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
-     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
-     disable caching.
-
-`--config-cache'
-`-C'
-     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
-
-`--quiet'
-`--silent'
-`-q'
-     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
-     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
-     messages will still be shown).
-
-`--srcdir=DIR'
-     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
-
-`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
-`configure --help' for more details.

-At the current time, the only supported WIN32 platform is 
-Microsoft Visual C++. You must have VC++ 6.0 at least.
-
-Quick Steps to compile & run a sample using the GUI TestRunner:
-- Open examples/examples.dsw in VC++ (contains all the samples)
-- Make HostApp the Active project
-- Compile
-- in VC++, Tools/Customize.../Add-ins and macro files/Browse...
-- select the file lib/TestRunnerDSPlugIn.dll and press ok to register
-  the add-ins (double-click on failure = open file in VC++).
-- Run the project
-
-
-Project build Target:
----------------------
-
-Framework & tools:
-
-* cppunit (cppunit.lib) : unit testing framework library, the one you use 
-to write unit tests.
-
-* cppunit_dll(cppunit_dll.dll/lib) : same as above, but build as a DLL.
-
-* DllPlugInTester(DllPlugInTester.exe) : test plug-in runner executable.
-Use this to test DLL in your post-build step, or debug them.
-
-* TestRunner (testrunner.dll) : a MFC extension DLL to run and browser unit 
-tests from a GUI.
-
-* DSPlugIn (lib/TestRunnerDSPlugIn.dll) : a VC++ add-in used by 
-testrunner.dll. If you double-click on a failure in the MFC TestRunner,
-a running instance of VC++ will open the file and highlight the line.
-
-* TestPlugInRunner : (Warning: experimental) a VC++ 
-application to run test plug-in. A test plug-in is a DLL that publish a 
-specified interface. This application is still incomplete (the auto-reload 
-feature is missing).
-
-All libraries are placed in the lib/ directory.
-
-
-Examples:
----------
-
-* CppUnitTestMain : the actual test suite use to test CppUnit. Use a 
-TextTestRunner, and post-build testing with CompilterOutputter. Configuration
-to link against cppunit static library and cppunit dll library.
-
-* CppUnitTestApp : contains the same test suite as CppUnitTestMain, but
-run them using the MFC TestRunner.
-
-* hierarchy : a sample demonstrating how to sublcass test (you might rather
-want to use HelperMacros.h and the CPPUNIT_TEST_SUB_SUITE macro which does
-it in a 'cleaner' way. That sample has not been updated for a long time).
-
-* HostApp : a sample using the MFC TestRunner demonstrating different test
-failure. Also demonstrates the MFC Unicode TestRunner.
-
-* Money : an example that come along with the Money article of the 
-documentation. Probably what you want to look at if you are a newbie.
-
-
-Configuration:
---------------
-
-CppUnit and TestRunner comes with 3 configurations.
-
-* Release (): Multihtreaded DLL, release mode
-* Debug (d): Debug Multithreaded DLL, debug mode
-* Unicode Release (u): Unicode Multihtreaded DLL, release mode
-* Unicode Debug (ud): Unicode Debug Multithreaded DLL, debug mode
-
-For CppUnit, when building as dll, "dll" is appended to the 'suffix'.
-
-The letters enclosed in brackets indicates the suffix added to
-the library name. For example, the debug configuration cppunit static library
-name is cppunitd.lib. The debug configuration cppunit dll name is cppunitd_dll.lib.
-
-
-Building:
----------
-
-* Open the src/CppUnitLibraries.dsw workspace in VC++.
-* In the 'Build' menu, select 'Batch Build...'
-* In the batch build dialog, select all projects and press the build button.
-* The resulting libraries can be found in the lib/ directory.
-
-
-Testing:
---------
-
-* Open the workspace examples/Examples.dsw.
-* Make CppUnitTestApp the active project.
-* Select the configuration you build the library for.
-* Compile and run the project. The TestRunner GUI should appear.
-
-
-Libraries:
-----------
-
-All the compiled libraries and DLL can be found in the 'lib' directory.
-Most libraries can be build from src/CppUnitLibraries.dsw workspace.
-
-lib\:
-cppunit.lib				: CppUnit static library "Multithreaded DLL"
-cppunitd.lib			: CppUnit static library "Debug Multithreaded DLL"
-cppunit_dll.dll			: CppUnit dynamic library (DLL) "Multithreaded DLL"
-cppunit_dll.lib			: CppUnit dynamic import library "Multithreaded DLL"

-testrunnerud.lib		: MFC Unicode TestRunner import library "Debug Multithreaded DLL"
-TestRunnerDSPlugIn.dll	: The add-in you register in VC++.
-
-Notes that when you are using CppUnit DLL (cppunit*_dll.dll), you must link 
-against the associated import library and define the pre-processor symbol 
-CPPUNIT_DLL in your project.
-
-
-Tools:
-------
-
-CppUnit provides a generic test runner for test plug-in: DllPlugInTester.
-It can be found in the lib/ directory. It requires cppunit*_dll.dll
-
-lib/:
-DllPlugInTester_dll.exe  : test plug-in runner, "Multithreaded DLL", cppunit_dll.dll
-DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe : test plug-in runner, "Debug Multithreaded DLL", cppunitd_dll.dll
-DllPlugInTester.exe  : test plug-in runner, "Multithreaded DLL", static link cppunit.lib
-DllPlugInTesterd.exe : test plug-in runner, "Debug Multithreaded DLL", static link cppunitd.lib
-
-Notes that the DllPlugInTester(d).exe version of this tools does not allow
-to use the automatic test registration that comes along with test plug-in.
-You probably don't want to use them unless you really now what you are doing.
-
-
-Using CppUnit:
---------------
-
-* Writing unit tests:
-  To write unit tests, you need to link against cppunitXX.lib, where
-  XX is the chosen configuration suffix letters. 
-  CppUnit include directory must be in the include search path.
-  You can do that by adding the include directory in 
-  Project Settings/C++/Preprocessor/Additional include directories,
-  or Tools/Options/Directories/Include.
-
-  Quick steps:
-  - link lib/cppunitXX.lib
-  - include/ must be in the include search path
-
-* Using the TestRunner GUI:
-  To use the test runner GUI you need to link against testrunnerXX.lib
-  and cppunitXX.lib, where XX is the chosen configuration suffix 
-  letters. testrunner.dll must be in the path when your program is
-  run (the Debug/Release directory, your project dsp directory, or
-  in a directory specified in the PATH environment variable).
-  One of the easiest way to do that is to either add a post-build
-  command or add the testrunner.dll which is in the lib/ directory
-  to your project and define a custom build step that copy the
-  dll to your "Intermediate" directory (Debug or Release usually).
-
-  Since the TestRunner GUI is a MFC extension DLL, it can access
-  the CWinApp of the using application. Settings are stored using 
-  the application registry key. That means that "most recently used
-  test" settings are different for each application.
-
-  Quick steps:
-  - link lib/cppunitXX.lib and lib/testrunnerXX.lib
-  - include/ must be in the include search path
-  - lib/testrunnerXX.dll must be available to run your project
-
-* Using the DSPlugIn:
-  You must register the plug-in with VC++. This is done in 
-  Tools/Customize/Add-ins and Macro files, selecting browse and
-  selecting lib/TestRunnerDSPlugIn.dll (you can register the release
-  or the debug version, both work).
-
-  If an instance of VC++ is running and you double-click on a failure,
-  VC++ will open the file and select the failure line.
-
-* Using the Test Plug In Runner:
-  Your DLL must export a function that implement the interface
-defined in include/msvc6/testrunner/TestPlugInInterface.h.
-See examples/msvc6/TestPlugIn/TestPlugInInterfaceImpl.* for an example.
-Be warned, that runner is still experimental and have not been tested
-much.

-See the file INSTALL for basic instructions.  A short explanation for
-each non-standard configure option follows.
-
-  --disable-typeinfo-name 
-
-Some output from the library will use a class name to distinguish
-between tests.  Normally, the Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) system
-is used (specifically, the type_info::name() function) to generate the
-name.  Some compilers return human-readable names via this interface.
-Other compilers do not.
-
-If your compiler does not generate a pleasing class name, specify
-this option; the names will be generated by other means.  The names
-are used only for diagnostic purposes -- no functionality will be
-lost nor gained by using this option.
-
-
-
-		System Notes
-		------------
-
-cygwin
-------
-
-We have a number of reports that the shared library fails to
-build properly.  This may manifest itself as a failure to
-build and run the test suite ("make check").
-
-The workaround is to build a static library only.  Configure using
-
-    ./configure --disable-shared
-
-Then build normally.
-
-
-
-DEC alpha with cxx V6.1-029 and RogueWave STL
----------------------------------------------
-
-A user reports that you have to issue the command
-
-    export DEC_CXX="-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -D__STD_MS"
-
-in order to get ostream defined in namespace std.  Otherwise, the
-build reports the following error.
-
-    Cannot define CppUnit::OStringStream
-
-
-
-If the compiler complains about 'exception', it may help to
-re-run configure with
-
-	CPPFLAGS='-U_OSF_SOURCE'
-
-on the configure line.  Please let us know about your experiences
-with this platform so that we can keep this information up-to-date.
-
-
-
-IRIX 6 / MIPSpro compiler
--------------------------
-
-The MIPSpro compiler requires the "-LANG:std" flag to enable the
-standard C++ library.  You must set the CC variable when you configure,
-as follows
-	./configure CC='CC -LANG:std'
-
-There is a bug in released versions of libtool prevents the -LANG flag
-from being properly passed during the linking stage.  To check if you
-have this bug, examine the output of "grep 'no.*irix' libtool".  If
-you see a line like "no/*-*-irix*)" then you suffer from the bug.  [A
-fixed version of libtool will look like "no/*-*-irix* | /*-*-irix*)".]
-
-If your libtool script suffers from the bug, open it in an editor,
-find the first line that contains "with_gcc", and change it to
-read "with_gcc=no".
-
-The MIPSpro version 7.30 is able to compile cppunit proper, but will
-fail to compile the example testsuite.  I am assuming this is due
-to known bugs in the compiler (7.30 is not the latest version). 
-The library appears to function OK.  Please let us know if you find
-it otherwise.
-
-
-Solaris/Sun CC compiler
------------------------
-
-Use the following configure line:
-
-./configure CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-pta -instances=static -mt 
--xtarget=generic -g -features=no%transitions 
--xildoff" LD=CC LDFLAGS=-xildoff
-
-In Forte C++ compiler for Solaris all the linking has to go via
-CC and ar, ld should not be run directly. For archive use CC -xar and
-for linking and generating the .so use  CC -G 
-
-Notes: CC 5.5 don't need that much flag to compile correctly. Though, I'm not
-sure what are the required one.
-
-
-AIX
----
-
-./configure --disable-shared
-
-The autogen tools don't seem to generate correctly script to handle dynamic linking.
-If anyone know how to get it working, please contact us.
-
-
-HP-UX
------
-Use the following options with configure to 
-enable the use of aCC and cc for the compilation of 
-CppUnit: 
-./configure --enable-hpuxshl CC=cc CXX=aCC CXXFLAGS="-AA"
-
-AA sets all the necessary flags to enable namespaces, 
-stl v2,....

-  New in CppUnit 1.10.0 (same as 1.9.14):
-  --------------------------------------
-
-* Assertions
-
-  - Ported exception assertion macros from cppunit 2 to the 1.9.x series:
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_THROW, CPPUNIT_ASSERT_NO_THROW, 
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT_ASSERTION_FAIL, CPPUNIT_ASSERT_ASSERTION_PASS.
-
-* Deprecated:
-
-  - The helper macros: CPPUNIT_TEST_FAIL & CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION have
-    been deprecated. Use the new exception assertion macros instead.
-
-* Bug Fix:
-
-  - cppunit-config: bug #903363, missing -ldl from the output of
-    cppunit-config --libs. Fixed thanks Eric Blossom patch.
-
-  - test plug-in(unix): Adding RTLD_GLOBAL allows test plug-ins 
-    to provide symbols to shared objects they load themselves.
-    Thanks goes to Gareth Sylvester for this patch (#816563).
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.12:
-  ---------------------
-
-* Test Plug-in
-
-  - added support contributed support for UNIX systems that
-    have libdld and not libdl (e.g. hp-ux). Contributed by
-    Abdessattar Sassi.
-
-* RTTI
-
-  - TypeInfoHelper now used gcc c++ abi to demangle typeinfo name thanks to
-    Neil Ferguson contribution.
-
-* Bug Fix:
-
-  - MFC TestRunner: integrated bug fix from Tim Threlkeld for bug 
-    #610191 and #610162. Fixed assertion when minizing dialog 
-    (bug #643612).
-
-  - XMLOutputter: Fixed bug #676505: no space inserted between attributes
-    of XmlElement.
-
-  - CppUnit portability: fixed many mistakes relating to compilation
-    without type info or namespace reported by Philip Craig.
-
-  - Missing destructor with no throw specification for 
-    DynamicLibraryManagerException. Bug #619059.
-
-  - Fixed missing export for operator <<(TextTestResult). Bug #610119.
-
-  - Missing include for typeinfo in TestNamer.h. Bug #662666.

-
-  - Fixed compilation issues for Borland C++ 6 and STLPort. Bug #694971,
-    #699794 and #662666.
-
-  - Fixed compilation issues for AIX.
-
-  - Fixed compilation issues for Visual C++ .NET 2002.
-
-  - Fixed doxygen usage in mingw environment (space not allowed in 
-    doxygen path). Bug #700730.
-
-  - Fixed compilation issue for mingw (bug #711583).
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.10:
-  ---------------------
-
-  - Major portability improvement
-  - Protector
-  - HelperMacros
-  - MFC TestRunner bug fixes
-  - Failure diagnostic
-  - Asserter
-
-* Major portability improvement:
-
-  - Much work has been done to reduce C++ feature requirement to compile
-    CppUnit. It should now be possible to compile CppUnit on most 
-    compilers, as long as STL are available (in std namespace or not), 
-    with some form of strstream and iostream, as well as exception support.
-    See CodingGuideLines.txt for details.
-
-* Protector
-
-  - Protector can be passed to the TestResult to 'protect' call to
-    setUp(), runTest() and tearDown() method. With this, it is easy to
-    capture exceptions which do not have std::exception as a base class,
-    such as CException or RWXMsg for example. TestResult and Protector 
-    class documentation. Look at src/cppunit/DefaultProtector.cpp for
-    an example of implementation.
-
-* Helper macros
-
-  - Mostly rewritten. It no longer use TestSuiteBuilder. A new object
-    TestSuiteBuilderContext was introduced. It is used to name test case,
-    create test fixture instance and add test to the fixture suite. It
-    is now much more easier to add custom test cases using
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_ADD_CUSTOM_TESTS. Should also prevent most 
-    compability break concerning that macro.
-
-  - Useful typedef are now public: TestFixtureType, ParentTestFixtureType.
-
-  - New typedef for custom test method parameter: 
-    typedef TestSuiteBuilderContext<TestFixtureType> 
-       TestSuiteBuilderContextType;
-
-  - added support for abstract test fixture with
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END_ABSTRACT(). See documentation for further
-    detail.
-
-* Failure diagnostic
-
-  - setUp() and tearDown() now provides a detailed diagnostic of the
-    failure (assertion, exception...)
-
-  - If RTTI is allowed to extract type info, CppUnit will report the
-    actual exception type in the diagnostic.
-
-* Asserter:
-  
-  - A new AdditionalMessage class has been introduced. It is used for
-    assertion that takes an additional 'message' argument 
-    (CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MESSAGE...). Since this macro has an implicit 
-    constructor that take a string, which creates a Message with the 
-    specified string as detail. That way, additional message can be a 
-    single string or a complex Message object. See documentation for 
-    example of use.
-
-* Bug Fix:
-
-  - MFC TestRunner: bug #530426 (conflict between TestRunner and host 
-    application's resources). A huge thanks to Steven Mitter for that one.
-
-  - MFC TestRunner: Browse button is now disabled while running test.
-
-* Deprecated
-
-  - CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner moved to CppUnit::TextTestRunner.
-  - CppUnit::MfcUi::TestRunner moved to CppUnit::MfcTestRunner.
-  - CppUnit::QtUi::TestRunner moved to CppUnit::QtTestRunner.
-
-* Compatiblity break:
-
-  - CppUnitTextUi::TestRunner, removed runTestByName() and runTest().
-  - TestSuiteBuilder: removed templatized method 
-    addTestCallerForException(). See implementation of 
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION implementation for an alternative.
-  - TestAssert: removed deprecated functions (those not using SourceLine) 
-    assertImplementation(), assertNotEqualImplementation(), 
-    assertEquals(). Moved non deprecated functions assertEquals() and
-    assertEquals() into CppUnit namespace.
-  - Plug-ins 'Parameters' typedef has been replaced by class 
-    PlugInParameters. The method commandLine() returns what used to be in
-    Parameters[0]. This should avoid future compatibility break when the 
-    parameters passing API will be defined.
-  - TestPlugIn::initialize() now takes a PlugInParameters in argument 
-    instead of a Parameters.
-  - template <class T> void assertEquals() no longer has a default message 
-    value (no impact, unless you used this function directly instead of
-    assertion macros).
-  - HelperMacros: renamed CPPUNIT_TEST_ADD to 
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_ADD_TEST.
-  - HelperMacros: removed CPPUNIT_TEST_CUSTOM. Instead use 
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_ADD_CUSTOM_TESTS and call context.addTest() 
-    passing the test that was returned.
-  - HelperMacros: renamed CPPUNIT_TEST_CUSTOMS to 
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_ADD_CUSTOM_TESTS. Changed method signature to
-    static void aMethodName( TestSuiteBuilderContextType &context ).
-    You can replace the 3 previous parameters by context. (See 
-    documentation for further detail).
-
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.8:
-  ---------------------
-
-  - New custom test macros for fixture suite
-  - Exception message are now structured
-  - Added detail field to MFC TestRunner
-  - New XmlDocument class to easily create new XML output format
-  - XmlOutputter customization
-  - Test plug-in XMLOutputter hook
-  - ClockerPlugIn example includes test time in XML output
-  - DllPlugInTester allows test plug-in to hook the XmlOutputter
-  - Configurable CompilerOutputter wrapping
-
-* New custom test macros
-
-  - 3 new macros have been added for use when declaring test fixture suite:
-    - CPPUNIT_TEST_CUSTOM : to specify a method that returns an instance of 
-      Test to add to the suite
-    - CPPUNIT_TEST_CUSTOM : to specify a method that add some tests to the 
-      suite
-    - CPPUNIT_TEST_ADD : to add a test to the suite. Used this to create custom 
-      CPPUNIT_TEST_xxx macros.
-
-    See macros documentation for examples and details.
-
-* Exception message
-
-  - Exception message are now stored in a Message object instead of a string.
-    A message is composed of two items:
-    - a short description (~20/30 characters)
-    - a list of detail strings
-
-    The short description is used to indicate how the detail strings should be
-    interpreted. It usually indicates the failure types, such as
-    "assertion failed", "forced failure", "unexpected exception caught",
-    "equality assertion failed"... It should not contains new line characters 
-    (\n).
-
-    Detail strings are used to provide more information about the failure. It
-    can contains the asserted expression, the expected and actual values in an
-    equality assertion, some addional messages... Detail strings can contains
-    new line characters (\n).
-
-    This change allow ouputters to deal with all failure the same way (there is
-    no special case for the equality assertion any more).
-
-* New XmlDocument class to easily create new XML output format
-
-  - Classes XmlDocument and XmlElement where extracted from XmlOutputter. This
-    help writing outputters that use a completly different XML format.
-
-  - XmlDocument represents a XML file, and XmlElement represents a XML element.
-
-* XmlOutputter customization
-
-  - Xml output can be customized using XmlOutputterHook. To do so, subclass
-    XmlOutputterHook and register it to the XmlOutputter with addHook() before
-    call XmlOutputter::write().
-
-    Hook can be used to add some datas to the XmlDocument or the XmlElement of
-    a specific hook. Methods have been added to XmlElement to help navigating
-    and modifying the XmlDocument.
-
-    See ClockerPlugIn example.
-
-* MFC TestRunner
-
-  - The name of the test is displayed just before being run.
-  - Browse Test Hierarchy dialog is resizable.
-  - Better (and cleaner) handling of windows resizing
-  - Failure list now only show the short description of the failure.
-  - Edit field added to display the details of the selected failure.
-
-* MFC test plug-in runner (TestPlugInRunner):
-  
-  - command line: a dll name can be specified on the command after -testsuite:
-    example: TestPlugInRunnerd.exe -testsuite Simpled.dll
-
-  - Layout configuration is stored/restored.
-
-* Test plug-in XML output Hook
-
-  - TestPlugIn interface provides a mean for plug-in to register hook for
-    XML output. Practically, this allow plug-in to add specific data to the
-    output. See ClockerPlugIn example, which add timing datas to the xml
-    output.
-
-* DllPlugInTester:
-
-  - added option -w / --wait to wait for the user to press a key before exiting.
-
-  - plug-in can now provides XmlOutputterHook to add specific datas to the 
-    XML ouput. See ClockerPlugIn example.
-
-* CompilerOutputter wrapping is parametrized
-
-  - Wrap column can be set with setWrapColumn(). Default is now 79 instead of 80.
-
-  - Wrapping can be disabled with setNoWrap().
-
-* Examples:
-
-  - ClockerPlugIn: the example now use the new XmlOutputterHook. Test time are
-    now included in the XML output. See examples/ClockerPlugIn/ReadMe.txt for
-    details.
-
-* Bug Fix:
-
-  - CompilerOutputter: fixed wrapping issues (UT magic!)
-
-  - DllPlugInTester: use ISO-LATIN1 encoding if none is given. Flag --xsl was
-    ignored.
-
-  - MfcUi plug-in runner (TesTPlugInRunner): better handling of history when
-    loading and reloading a dll. 
-
-  - Qt Test Runner: minor bug fixes. Should compile on Unix.
-
-  - XmlOutputter: use the default encoding if an empty string is given as
-    encoding
-
-* Compatibility Break:
-
-  - CompilerOutputter: removed printNotEqualMessage() and printDefaultMessage().
-    No longer needed since Exception message are processed in a generic way.
-    Removed wrap(). Extracted to StringTools.
-
-  - Exception constructor takes a Message instead of a string. Notes that the
-    first argument in Message constructor is a short description, not the message.
-    Therefore, the change will usualy have the following form:
-      Exception( Message( "assertion failed", oldMessage ) );
-    You may want to use Asserter functions instead of constructing and throwing
-    the exception manually.
-
-  - TestPlugInAdapter: renamed TestPlugInDefaultImpl.
-
-  - TestSuiteBuilder: removed default constructor. All remaining constructors
-    take an additional argument of type TestNamer used to specify the fixture
-    named and generate test case name. Remove template method 
-    addTestCallerForException(). Use addTest() instead (see 
-    CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION implementation).
-
-  - TextTestResult: most printing method were removed. This task is now delegated
-    to TextOuputter.
-
-  - XmlElement: renamed addNode() to addElement().
-
-  - XmlOutputter: removed methods writeProlog() and writeTestResult() which
-    are replaced by XmlDocument. Renamed makeRootNode() to setRootNode(). It
-    no longer returns the root node, but set the root node of the XML document.
-
-  - XmlOuputter::Node: class has been extracted and renamed XmlElement.
-
-* Deprecated:
-
-  - Asserter: all functions that use a string for the failure message. Construct
-    a Message instead (see Exception constructor compatiblity break and
-    Exception message feature).
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.6:
-  ---------------------
-
-  - DllPlugInTester can be parametrized from command line
-  - Two test listener plug-in examples
-  - An 'hello world' example & getting started document : Money
-  - Contribution: generic makefile for Borland 5.5 free compiler.
-  - Bug fixes
-
-* DllPlugInTester:
-
-  - Advanced command line to support miscellaneous listener outputer.
-    Parameters can now be passed to test plug-in:
-
-    -c --compiler
-      Use CompilerOutputter
-    -x --xml [filename]
-      Use XmlOutputter (if filename is omitted, then output to cout or
-      cerr.
-    -s --xsl stylesheet
-      XML style sheet for XML Outputter
-    -e --encoding encoding
-      XML file encoding (UTF8, shift_jis, ISO-8859-1...)
-    -b --brief-progress
-      Use BriefTestProgressListener (default is TextTestProgressListener)
-    -n --no-progress
-      Show no test progress (disable default TextTestProgressListener)
-    -t --text
-      Use TextOutputter
-    -o --cout
-      Ouputters output to cout instead of the default cerr.
-    filename[="options"]
-      Many filenames can be specified. They are the name of the 
-      test plug-ins to load. Optional plug-ins parameters can be 
-      specified after the filename by adding '='.
-    [:testpath]
-      Optional. Only one test path can be specified. It must 
-      be prefixed with ':'. See TestPath constructor for syntax.
-
-    'parameters' (test plug-in or XML filename, test path...) may contains 
-    spaces if double quoted. Quote may be escaped with \".
-
-    Some examples of command lines:
-DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe -b -x tests.xml -c simple_plugind.dll CppUnitTestPlugInd.dll
-    Will load 2 tests plug-ins (available in lib/), use the brief test
-    progress, output the result in XML in file tests.xml and also
-    output the result using the compiler outputter.
-
-DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe ClockerPlugInd.dll="flat" -n CppUnitTestPlugInd.dll
-    Will load the 2 test plug-ins, and pass the parameter string "flat"
-    to the Clocker plug-in, disable test progress. Clocker being a test
-    listener plug-ins (it doesn't implements any tests, it just register
-    a TestListener), this is equivalent to say 'run all the test
-    of CppUnitTestPlugIn and use ClockerPlugIn as a TestLisener'.
-
-DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe CppUnitTestPlugInd.dll :Core
-    Will run the test named "Core" (a suite in the present case ) of the 
-    test plug-in.
-
-* Documentation
-
-  - New getting started documentation. Not completed yet, but probably
-    a good complement to the current cookbook. Explore the creation
-    of the Money example.
-
-* Examples
-
-  - Money (examples/Money): the 'hello world' example. Unit tests for 
-    a simple Money class.
-
-  - DllPlugInTesterTest (src/DllPlugInTester/DllPlugInTester.dsp):
-    unit tests for CommandLineParser. Not really an example, but only
-    slightly more complex than Money.
-
-  - ClockerPlugIn (examples/ClockerPlugIn): a test listener plug-in 
-    that track tests and test suites running time. Parameter: "flat" 
-    for a reporting with a flattened tree.
-
-  - DumperPlugIn (examples/DumperPlugIn): a test listener plug-in that 
-    dump the test tree as it run. Paramater: "flat" for a reporting 
-    with a flattened tree.
-
-  - CppUnitTestPlugIn (examples/cppunitest/CppUnitTestPlugIn.dsp):
-    CppUnit's test suite as a test plug-in.
-
-* Contribution
-
-  - Contributed by project cuppa team (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/cuppa/):
-
-  - Makefile for CppUnit with Borland C++ 5.5 free compiler: does not
-    depend on a specific CppUnit version.
-
-* Compatiblity breaks
-
-  - DllPlugInTester: (1.9.4 only), should add -c to DllPlugInTester 
-    command line.
-
-* Bug Fix:
-
-  - DynamicLibaryManager did not report the library name when loading a
-    a library.
-
-  - BeosDynamicLibraryManager: fixed thanks to Shibu Yoshiki 
-    ('cuppa' project team).
-
-  - Broken build on Unix should be fixed for most (thanks to 
-    Jeffrey Morgan).
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.4:
-  ----------------------
-
-  - More versatile, easier to make test plug-in.
-  - A PlugInManager to manage multiple test plug-ins.
-  - Crossplatform test plug-in runner.
-  - Crossplatform test plug-in example.
-  - A brief progress listener 
-  - Easier test hierarchy creation
-  - Improved documentation.
-  - Tracking of test run start/end.
-  - Contribution: XML style sheet & borland 5.5 makefile.
-  - Help needed on the Unix side!
-
-* Buildling on Unix:
-
-  - I did not get any feed back on the previous build issue on Unix. Using
-    a simple autobook example was useless to try to solve the problem. Here
-  is the issue:
-
-  CppUnit library build fine, it is the example I'm having trouble with.
-
-  Since the test plug-in have been added, CppUnit use the function
-  dlopen(), dlsym() and dlclose() on unix to load/unload the plug-in.
-
-  Those functions apparently requires to link another library when
-  building an exectuable. Here is was should be done:
-  - linking against the said library for each example.
-  - generates the shared library for the examples/simple/simple_plugin 
-    example (source files are ExampleTestCase.cpp, ExampleTestCase.cpp 
-    and SimplePlugIn.cpp).
-  - if possible, makes the above optionnal if --disable-test-plug-in 
-    is defined:
-    - don't link the dlXXX library 
-    - don't compile the plug-in example
-    - add #define CPPUNIT_NO_TESTPLUGIN 1 to the config file
-
-  Contact me on the mailing-list for more details.
-
-* TestPlugIn:
-
-  - A simple fact I realised while testing: if you link your test plug-in 
-    against the DLL version of cppunit (or shared library on Unix), then
-  test registered to the TestFactoryRegistry (it is what's hide behind
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION) are automatically shared. Changes
-  have been made to support that usage (CppUnit was crashing badly).
-  Using the TestFactoryRegistry provides much more flexiblity that
-  providing a single suite for the plug-in. As such:
-
-  - CppUnit plug-in should be linked against the dll version of CppUnit library.
-
-  - Plug-in should register their tests using the CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_xxx macros.
-
-  - 'homemade' suite can still be registred to the TestFactoryRegistry that is
-     passed as parameter on plug-in initialization. Notes that you must 
-   unregister those suites during plug-in uninitialization, otherwise on
-   destruction, the TestFactoryRegistry will attempt to destroy them... Your
-   plug-in would have been already unloaded...
-
-  - Plug-in can accept parameters on initialization (notes that the Parameters
-    object is far from being stabilized, but whatever form it takes, it will be
-  a list of string).
-    
-  - Plug-in can register their one listener for a test run. This means that you
-    can extends 'DllPlugInTester' by creating test plug-in... This also means
-  than you can listen to startTestRun()/endTestRun() to do some global
-  setUp/tearDown (to initialize globales resources, such as COM...)
-
-  - Why all this fuss around test plug-in ? Test plug-in are the incarnation of
-    an old concept: testable components...
-
-* PlugInManager:
-
-  - The PlugInManager is used to load/unload plug-ins. It takes care of all
-    the 'plug-in' protocol and makes it easy to use multiple plug-ins at the
-  same time. It dispatches the addListener()/removeListener() message to
-  each plug-in.
-
-* Crossplatform test plug-in runner (src/DllPlugInRunner):
-
-  - This application can be used to run your test plug-ins. It can load
-    multiple test plug-ins and run all or a specific test in the test
-  hierarchy returned by TestFactoryRegistry::getRegistry().makeTest().
-
-  - Plug-in loaded by the plug-in may also be custom TestListener.
-
-  - It can be use for post-build check and to debug the plug-in.
-
-  - Why use it? It keep you away from CppUnit API changes!
-
-* Easier test hierarchy creation (TestFactoryRegistry/HelperMacros):
-
-  - added method addRegistry(name) to add a named registry to the registry.
-    see TestFactoryRegistry for an example of use.
-
-  - added macros CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD( which, to ) and 
-    CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD_TO_DEFAULT( which ) to create test hierarchy at static
-  initialization (in the spirit of CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_xxx() macros).
-
-* VerboseTestProgressListener:
-
-  - A new TestListener that prints the test name before running it. Most useful when
-    a test crashing, mean a application crash.
-
-* Documentation:
-
-  - More details about the test plug-in, how to use it, how does it works...
-    See module/Writing Test Plug-in.
-
-* Examples:
-
-  - examAdded crossplatform simple example. Equivalent to VC++ HostApp example.
-  - examples/simple: a very simple example, demonstrating the use of CppUnit
-    with a single TestFixture. Demonstrate both how to build an application
-  using TestRunner, and how to build a test plug-in to use with the
-  test plug-in runner.
-
-* Contribution
-
-  - Contributed by project cuppa team (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/cuppa/):
-
-  - XML style sheet: transform CppUnit XML output into HTML.
-  - Makefile for CppUnit with Borland C++ 5.5 free compiler.
-
-* Behavior changes:
-
-  - Test runner should call TestResult::runTest() to run the 'top level' test. This
-    will inform the TestListener of the test run start/end.
-
-* Compatiblity break:
-
-  - TestFactoryRegistry don't own register test anymore. AutoRegisterSuite has
-    been updated to preverse its apparent behavior. It should be of concern
-  if you created and registered custom TestFactory.
-
-  - Removed TextTestProgressListener::done(). No longer needed, it listens
-    for endTestRun().
-
-* Compatiblity Break for 1.9.2 users:
-
-  - TestPlugIn.h: CppUnitTestPlugIn as been completly rewritten.
-
-  - TestPlugIn.h: macro CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT() don't take any arguments.
-
-  - TestSuitePlugIn: removed. A similar functionnality is provided by 
-    PlugInManager.
-
-  - TestPlugInDefaultImpl: renamed TestPlugInAdapter. It does not implements
-    any default behavior anymore.
-
-  - DllPlugInRunner: no longer support multiple specific tests. The test path must
-    be prefixed with ':'. Release and Debug configuration links against cppunit_dll.
-
-* Bug Fix:
-
-  - Crash when linking CppUnit DLL within another DLL that registered test. Caused
-    by the destruction of tests registered to TestFactoryRegistry. Fixed by
-  providing a register/unregister interface and removing the ownership of 
-  TestFactory to TestFactoryRegistry.
- 
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.2:
-  ----------------------
-
-  In short:
-  - Cleaner XML output
-  - Crossplatform Test plug-in
-  - TestPlugInSuite to wrap test plug-in
-  - More TestPlugIn documentation.
-
-* TestPlugIn:
-  - The test plug-in functionnality has been rewritten from scrash. 
-    TestPlugIn related macro are now crossplatform (exporting the plug-in
-  function from the dynamic library...).
-
-  - Class DynamicLibraryManager provides a generic way to access dynamic 
-    library. Platform specific implementation provided for WIN32, unix, BeOs.
-  Can be very easily ported to new platform.
-  
-  - A More flexible and hopefully extensible interface has been introduced
-    (CppUnitPlugIn). 
-  
-  - A default implementation using the test factory registry is provided 
-    (TestPlugInDefaultImpl). Can be easily customized.
-
-  - The one line test plug-in declaration was renamed CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT.
-
-  See modules/Writing Test Plug-in documentation and examples/EasyTestPlugIn.
-
-* XmlOutputter:
-
-  - XML output is now indented. Nodes that don't have children are one line 
-    tag. The output can now easily be read.
-
-* Compatibility break:
-
-  - class TestSucessListener was renamed to TestSuccessListener.
-
-  - XmlOutput: renamed tag <SuccessfulTests> to <SuccessfulTests>
-
-  - Global fix of the 'success' typo (was misspelled 'sucess'). Main impacts are listed
-    above, but check your own code in case you override some protected/private methods.
-
-  - TestPlugInInterface (include/msvc6/TestPlugInInterface.h): this header and class
-    are now obsolete. You should use include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugIn.h instead.
-  Macro CPPUNIT_TESTPLUGIN_IMPL have been replaced by CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT.
-
-  - TestDecorator inherits Test instead of TestLeaf.
-
-  - DllPlugInTester only run DLL implementing the new new TestPlugIn interface.
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.9.0:
-  ----------------------
-
-  In short:
-  - Exploration of the test hierarchy without RTTI support
-  - Utility methods to find a test in the hierarchy
-  - TestPath to store/load the path to a specific test in the hierarchy
-  - Generic TestRunner
-  - Style sheet support added to XML ouput.
-  - CompilerOutputter supports run-time parametrization of error location format.
-  - Tracking of test suite run.
-  - Debugging and post-build testing of DLL using DllPlugInTester.
-  - Easy creation a test plug-in and test plug-in new example
-
-* Test:
-
-  - Exploration of the test hierarchy without RTTI support:
-    Added Test::getChildTestCount() and Test::getChildTestAt() to walk the test hierarchy
-  without RTTI.
-
-  - Utility methods to find a test in the hierarchy:
-  Added Test::findTest(), Test::findTestPath() and Test::resolveTestPath().
-
-* TestPath:
-
-  - A new class that store the path to a specific test (list of pointer). Can be
-    converted into a string and constructed from a string. Typically used with 
-  TestRunner.
-
-* TestListener:
-
-  - Added startSuite() and endSuite() callback that are called before and after a
-    test suite runs its child tests. See TestListener for detail and new example.
-
-* CompilerOutputter:
-
-  - Support run-time parametrization of compiler error format. Support for gcc error
-    format added. See CompilerOutputter::setLocationFormat().
-
-* XmlOutputter:
-
-  - Added style sheet support.
-
-  - XML structure change (see Compatibility break)
-
-* DllPlugInTester: (src/msvc6/DllPlugInTester, in src/CppUnitLibraries.dsw)
-
-  - An application to load a DLL test plug-in and run the specified test. Test
-    result are reported using a CompilerOutputter. It can be used for post-build
-  testing, but to debug DLL too! See examples/msvc6/TestPlugIn/TestPlugIn.dsp
-  which demonstrate both.
-
-* TestPlugInInterface (include/msvc6/TestPlugInInterface.h):
-
-  - Easy creation a test plug-in with the new macro CPPUNIT_TESTPLUGIN_IMPL
-    that implements and exports everything for you. 
-  See examples/msvc6/EasyTestPlugIn for an example.
-
-
-* Compatibility break:
-
-  - Test::toString() has been removed. Applies to all subclass of Test. 
-    It was not used by the framework and was source of confusion with getName().
-
-  - TestCase::run(void) and TestCase::defaultResult() have been removed. Using the
-    run() method with a TestResult instead.
-
-  - XmlOutput: added a message element to the XML structure. The message associated
-    to a failure is now in the content of <Message> element instead of in the content
-  of the <FailedTest> element.
-  Changed from:
-        <FailedTest id="6">
-          <Name>test6</Name>
-          <FailureType>Error</FailureType>
-          error2
-        </FailedTest>
-  To:
-        <FailedTest id="6">
-          <Name>test6</Name>
-          <FailureType>Error</FailureType>
-          <Message>error2</Message>
-        </FailedTest>
-
-
-* Deprecated:
-
-  - CompilerOutputter::defaultOutputter(): use default constructor instead.
-
-
-* Bug fix:
-
-  - XmlOutputter: did not escape content (bug #540944).
-
-  - Included qt/examples in distribution
-
-  - Removed dependency of MfcTestRunner on DSPlugIn. It should now compile with
-    VC++ 7.
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.8.0:
-  ----------------------
-
-  In short:
-  - new assertions
-  - new facilities to write custom assertions
-  - new macros to define test case in your fixture
-  - registration of test fixture in named suite
-  - xml & compiler format test result output
-  - a new graphic test runner for the QT library
-  - MFC test runner window is resizable
-  - cppunit as a DLL
-  - Unicode support for MFC test runner.
-  - architecture clean-up: TestResultCollector extracted from TestResult.
-  - architecture clean-up: TestFixture extracted from TestCase.
-  - cookbook and documentation updated.
-
-* New assertion (TestAssert.h):
-
-  CPPUNIT_FAIL(message) : equivalent to CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MESSAGE( message, false )
-
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL_MESSAGE( expectedValue, actualValue, additionalMessage ):
-  behave like CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL but allow to add some contextual information.
-
-* New macros to write test case (HelperMacros.h):
-
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION that expect an exception of a specified type to
-  be thrown.
-
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_FAIL that expect a test to fail.
-
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_NAMED_REGISTRATION to register a suite in a named suite. See
-  cppunittest example for a demo.
-
-* TextTestRunner (TextTestRunner.h):
-  -run() returns a boolean indicating is the run was successful.
-  -the constructor and setOutputter() allow you do define a specific outputter
-  to print the test result (CompilerOutputter, TextOutputter, XmlOutputter...)
-  -result() provide access to the result of the test run.
-  -eventManager() give access to the TestResult, allowing you to register others
-  TestListener.
-
-* TestResult (TestResult.h):
-  - That class has been splitted in two: TestResult and TestResultCollector.
-
-  - TestResult manages the TestListener (registration and event dispatch), as
-  well as the stop flag indicating if the current test run should be interrupted.
-  All other responsabilites have been moved to TestResultCollector.
-
-  - TestResult no longer hold the result of the test run (this is done by
-  TestResultCollector which is a TestListener).
-
-* TestListener (TestListener.h):
-  - all failures and errors are reported using a single method:
-    virtual void addFailure( const TestFailure &failure )
-  => the failure object life time is limited to that of the method call.
-  Use TestFailure::isError() to distinguish error from failure.
-  Use TestFailure::clone() to obtain a duplicate of the failure.
-
-* New helpers to construct your own assertion (Asserter.h):
-
-  It is now very easy to create your own assertion macro with failure
-  location.
-
-  Asserter namespace contains functions used to construct and throw exception
-  to report failure. See Asserter documentation for an example of usage, and
-  examples/cppunittest/XmlUniformiser.h for a real life example.
-
-  CPPUNIT_SOURCELINE() macro have been added (SourceLine.h). It captures the 
-  failure location in a SourceLine object. Use it to write your own macros.
-
-  Asserter namespace contains functions used to construct and throw exception
-  to report failure. See Asserter documentation for an example of usage, and
-  examples/cppunittest/XmlUniformiser.h for a real life example.
-
-* TestListener (TestListener.h):
-
-  - TestSucesssListener : a simple listener that checks if a test has failed.
-
-  - TestResultCollector : store all the test result. This class has been 
-  extracted from the hold TestResult class.
-
-  - TextTestProgressListener : print dot on cout to each time a test ends.
-  Letter 'F' and 'E' are printed when a failure or an error occurs.
-
-* Output (Outputter.h):
-
-  - XML output: You can dump the TestResult as an XML document using 
-  XmlOutputter. See examples/cppunittest/XmlOutputterTest.cpp for document
-  structure and usage.
-
-  - Compiler compatible output : CompilerOutputter print the result in a 
-  compiler compatible format. You can use your IDE to jump to the first 
-  failure. See examples/cppunittest/CppUniTestMain.cpp for an example of usage.
-
-  - Text output : replace the deprecated TextTestResult. Print the result in
-  a human readable format.
-
-* NotEqualException constructor take an additional message (usually used to
-point out where the difference occured between the expected and actual value)
-that can be retreived with additionalMessage(). See Asserter documentation for
-an example of usage.
-
-* CppUnit
-
-  - CppUnit can be compiled as a DLL (WIN32 platform). 
-  DLL can be generated by the cppunit_dll.dsp project. You must define the 
-  pre-processor symbol CPPUNIT_DLL when linking against CppUnit DLL.
-  See cppunittests examples for an example.
-
-* TestRunner
-
-  - Qt TestRunner : a test runner for the Qt library (http://www.trolltech.com).
-    See examples/qt for an example of use.
-
-  - MFC TestRunner : the dialog can now be resized. List view column sizes, 
-  as well as the dialog size, are saved. Unicode configurations have been added.
-
-* Deprecated
-
-  - TextTestResult : use the test listener TextTestProgressListener and the
-  ouputter TextOuputter instead.
-
-  - Methods having fileName, lineNumber as parameter. Usually replaced by
-  a similar method that take a SourceLine parameter. Exception and
-  TestAssert are impacted.
-
-  - TestRegistryFactory::registerFactory( const std::string &name,
-                                          TestFactory *factory ).
-  
-    You must define the symbol CPPUNIT_ENABLE_SOURCELINE_DEPRECATED to enable
-  old Exception constructor, UNKNOWNFILENAME and UNKNOWNLINENUMBER, as well
-  as function defined in the TestAssert namespace. The exception construction
-  and throwing as been moved to Asserter namespace.
-
-* Compatibility break:
-
-  TestResult has been splitted in two class. TestResultCollector compatibility
-  breaks refer to the methods that were previously in TestResult.
-
-  - TestListener::addError() was removed. addFailure() is used to report
-any kind of failure.
-  - TestResultCollector::errors() was removed. Use failures() instead.
-  - TestResultCollector::failures() now reports all kind of failures.
-  - TestResultCollector::failures() returns a const reference.
-  - void TestListener::addFailure( TestFailure *failure ) was removed.
-  - void TestListener::addError( TestFailure *failure ) signature changed.
-
-  - CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL_MESSAGE: changed arguments order. 'message' is now 
-    the first argument instead of the last (like CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MESSAGE).
-  Notes that CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL was introduced in release 1.7.3.
-
-  - directory for TestRunners as moved from cppunitui/ to cppunit/ui/ (concern
-  only users of release 1.7.10)
-
-* Bug fix:
-  - test ExceptionTest.testAssignment() don't fail anymore on VC++. See FAQ
-    for detail.
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.6.1
-  --------------------
-
-* This is a bug-fixing release.
-
-
-  New in CppUnit 1.6.0
-  --------------------
-
-* All CppUnit macros now begin with "CPPUNIT_".  
-
-  Macros CU_TEST_SUITE, CU_TEST, CU_TEST_SUITE_END, CU_TEST_SUB_SUITE,
-  and CU_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION are renamed but are otherwise unchanged;
-  they take the same arguments, and have the same effect.  The old-style
-  macros can be used if your sources #define CPPUNIT_ENABLE_CU_TEST_MACROS
-  to 1 before including any CppUnit headers.
-
-  Macros assert, assertEqual, and assertDoublesEqual, have been replaced
-  by CPPUNIT_ASSERT, CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL, and CPPUNIT_ASSERT_DOUBLES_EQUAL,
-  respectively.  Macro assertLongsEqual is replaced by CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL.
-  The old assert macros can be used if your sources #define
-  CPPUNIT_ENABLE_NAKED_ASSERT to 1 before including any CppUnit headers.
-
-  The old macro names are deprecated and will vanish in a future version
-  of CppUnit.
-
-
-* Equality assertion CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL(expected,actual) can test
-  any type of expression.  The types of "expected" and "actual" must
-  be the same; use a cast if necessary.
-
-
-* Equality tested using CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL may be re-defined using
-  a traits class.  Ditto for the string representation used in the
-  diagnostic messages.
-
-
-* New assertion with arbitrary message: CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MESSAGE.
-
-
-* A test case obtained using class TestCaller may check that
-  a particular exception is thrown.
-
-
-* CppUnit has a test suite for itself!
-
-
-* VC++ integration for MFC TestRunner.

-dnl In most cases, the configure.in will contain a line saying
-dnl         AC_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h) 
-dnl somewhere *before* AC_OUTPUT and a simple line saying
-dnl        AC_PREFIX_CONFIG_HEADER
-dnl somewhere *after* AC_OUTPUT.
-dnl
-dnl example:
-dnl   AC_INIT(config.h.in)        # config.h.in as created by "autoheader"
-dnl   AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(testpkg, 0.1.1)   # "#undef VERSION" and "PACKAGE"

-dnl   AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)                # creates the "config.h" now
-dnl   AC_CREATE_PREFIX_CONFIG_H          # creates "testpkg-config.h"

-dnl   #endif
-dnl   #ifndef TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H

-dnl   #endif
-dnl   #ifndef _testpkg_const 
-dnl   #define _testpkg_const const
-dnl   #endif
-dnl
-dnl   and this "testpkg-config.h" can be installed along with other
-dnl   header-files, which is most convenient when creating a shared
-dnl   library (that has some headers) where some functionality is
-dnl   dependent on the OS-features detected at compile-time. No
-dnl   need to invent some "testpkg-confdefs.h.in" manually. :-)

-dnl @synopsis AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H [(OUTPUT-HEADER [,PREFIX [,ORIG-HEADER]])]
-dnl
-dnl This is a new variant from ac_prefix_config_ this one will use a
-dnl lowercase-prefix if the config-define was starting with a
-dnl lowercase-char, e.g. "#define const", "#define restrict", or
-dnl "#define off_t", (and this one can live in another directory, e.g.
-dnl testpkg/config.h therefore I decided to move the output-header to
-dnl be the first arg)
-dnl
-dnl takes the usual config.h generated header file; looks for each of
-dnl the generated "#define SOMEDEF" lines, and prefixes the defined
-dnl name (ie. makes it "#define PREFIX_SOMEDEF". The result is written
-dnl to the output config.header file. The PREFIX is converted to
-dnl uppercase for the conversions.
-dnl
-dnl Defaults:
-dnl
-dnl   OUTPUT-HEADER = $PACKAGE-config.h
-dnl   PREFIX = $PACKAGE
-dnl   ORIG-HEADER, from AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)
-dnl
-dnl Your configure.ac script should contain both macros in this order,
-dnl and unlike the earlier variations of this prefix-macro it is okay
-dnl to place the AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H call before the AC_OUTPUT
-dnl invokation.
-dnl
-dnl Example:
-dnl
-dnl   AC_INIT(config.h.in)        # config.h.in as created by "autoheader"
-dnl   AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(testpkg, 0.1.1)    # makes #undef VERSION and PACKAGE
-dnl   AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)          # prep config.h from config.h.in
-dnl   AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H(mylib/_config.h) # prep mylib/_config.h from it..
-dnl   AC_MEMORY_H                         # makes "#undef NEED_MEMORY_H"
-dnl   AC_C_CONST_H                        # makes "#undef const"
-dnl   AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)                 # creates the "config.h" now
-dnl                                       # and also mylib/_config.h
-dnl
-dnl if the argument to AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H would have been omitted then
-dnl the default outputfile would have been called simply
-dnl "testpkg-config.h", but even under the name "mylib/_config.h" it
-dnl contains prefix-defines like
-dnl
-dnl   #ifndef TESTPKG_VERSION
-dnl   #define TESTPKG_VERSION "0.1.1"
-dnl   #endif
-dnl   #ifndef TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H
-dnl   #define TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H 1
-dnl   #endif
-dnl   #ifndef _testpkg_const
-dnl   #define _testpkg_const _const
-dnl   #endif
-dnl
-dnl and this "mylib/_config.h" can be installed along with other
-dnl header-files, which is most convenient when creating a shared
-dnl library (that has some headers) where some functionality is
-dnl dependent on the OS-features detected at compile-time. No need to
-dnl invent some "mylib-confdefs.h.in" manually. :-)
-dnl
-dnl Note that some AC_DEFINEs that end up in the config.h file are
-dnl actually self-referential - e.g. AC_C_INLINE, AC_C_CONST, and the
-dnl AC_TYPE_OFF_T say that they "will define inline|const|off_t if the
-dnl system does not do it by itself". You might want to clean up about
-dnl these - consider an extra mylib/conf.h that reads something like:
-dnl
-dnl    #include <mylib/_config.h>
-dnl    #ifndef _testpkg_const
-dnl    #define _testpkg_const const
-dnl    #endif
-dnl
-dnl and then start using _testpkg_const in the header files. That is
-dnl also a good thing to differentiate whether some library-user has
-dnl starting to take up with a different compiler, so perhaps it could
-dnl read something like this:
-dnl
-dnl   #ifdef _MSC_VER
-dnl   #include <mylib/_msvc.h>
-dnl   #else
-dnl   #include <mylib/_config.h>

-# Configuration subroutine to validate and canonicalize a configuration type.
-# Supply the specified configuration type as an argument.
-# If it is invalid, we print an error message on stderr and exit with code 1.
-# Otherwise, we print the canonical config type on stdout and succeed.
-
-# This file is supposed to be the same for all GNU packages
-# and recognize all the CPU types, system types and aliases
-# that are meaningful with *any* GNU software.
-# Each package is responsible for reporting which valid configurations
-# it does not support.  The user should be able to distinguish
-# a failure to support a valid configuration from a meaningless
-# configuration.
-
-# The goal of this file is to map all the various variations of a given
-# machine specification into a single specification in the form:
-#	CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
-# or in some cases, the newer four-part form:
-#	CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
-# It is wrong to echo any other type of specification.

-.TH cppunit 1 "September 2001"
-.SH NAME
-cppunit-config - script to get information about the installed version of cppunit
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.B cppunit-config
-[\-\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fP] [\-\-exec\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fP] [\-\-version] [\-\-libs] [\-\-cflags]
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.PP
-\fIcppunit-config\fP is a tool that is used to configure to determine
-the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link
-programs that use \fIcppunit\fP. It is also used internally to the .m4
-macros for GNU autoconf that are included with \fIcppunit\fP.
-.
-.SH OPTIONS
-.l
-\fIcppunit-config\fP accepts the following options:
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-version
-Print the currently installed version of \fIcppunit\fP on the standard
-output.
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-libs
-Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a \fIcppunit\fP
-program.
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-cflags
-Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a \fIcppunit\fP
-program.
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-prefix
-Print the prefix with which \fIcppunit\fP was compiled.
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
-If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
-\fIcppunit\fP was built with when computing the output for the
-\-\-cflags and \-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec
-prefix if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be
-specified before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-exec\-prefix
-Print the exec\-prefix with which \fIcppunit\fP was compiled.
-.TP 8
-.B  \-\-exec\-prefix=PREFIX
-If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that
-\fIcppunit\fP was built with when computing the output for the
-\-\-cflags and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before
-any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.

-Frequently Asked Questions:
----------------------------
-
-1) Questions relating to CppUnit
-   ----------------------------
-
-1.1) Isn't there an easier way to write unit tests than using TestCaller ?
-
-   Yes, there is. Macros have been created to take care of the repetitive 
-work. Look up include/extensions/HelperMacros.h in CppUnit documentation. 
-Most of CppUnit test suite is also written that way since they remain 
-compatible as CppUnit evolve. They also use RTTI if available.
-
-
-2) Questions related to Microsoft Visual VC++
-   -----------------------------------------
-
-2.1) Why does the compiler report an error when linking with CppUnit library?
-
-   You most likely are not using the same C-RunTime library as CppUnit.
-   In Release configuration, CppUnit use "Mulithreaded DLL".
-   In Debug configurations, CppUnit use "Debug Multihreaded DLL".
-   Check that Projects/Settings.../C++/Code Generation is indeed using
-the correct library.
-   
-2.2) Why does CppUnit generate warning 4786:... when compiling ?
-
-   I really don't have a clue. All CppUnit's headers starts by either
-including Portability.h or another CppUnit's header. Portability.h includes
-config-msvc6.h which disable that specific warning. The warning is generated
-by TestFactoryRegistry::m_factories. A solution to this problem is welcome.

-\section sec_setting_vc Setting up your project (VC++)
-
-\subsection sec_install Compiling and installing CppUnit libaries
-
-In the following document, $CPPUNIT is the directory where you unpacked %CppUnit:
-$CPPUNIT/:
-	include/
-	lib/
-	src/
-		cppunit/
-
-First, you need to compile %CppUnit libraries:
-- Open the $CPPUNIT/src/CppUnitLibraries.dsw workspace in VC++.
-- In the 'Build' menu, select 'Batch Build...'
-- In the batch build dialog, select all projects and press the build button.
-- The resulting libraries can be found in the $CPPUNIT/lib/ directory.
-
-Once it is done, you need to tell VC++ where are the includes and librairies
-to use them in other projects. Open the 'Tools/Options...' dialog, and in the
-'Directories' tab, select 'include files' in the combo. Add a new entry that
-points to $CPPUNIT/include/. Change to 'libraries files' in the combo and 
-add a new entry for $CPPUNIT/lib/. Repeat the process with 'source files' 
-and add $CPPUNIT/src/cppunit/.
-
-\subsection sec_getting_started Getting started
-
-Creates a new console application ('a simple application' template will do).
-Let's link %CppUnit library to our project. In the project settings:
-- In tab 'C++', combo 'Code generation', set the combo to 'Multithreaded DLL'
-for the release configuration, and 'Debug Multithreaded DLL' for the debug
-configure,
-- In tab 'C++', combo 'C++ langage', for All Configurations, check 
-'enable Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)',
-- In tab 'Link', in the 'Object/library modules' field, add cppunitd.lib for
-the debug configuration, and cppunit.lib for the release configuration.
-
-We're done !
-
-
-  
-    
-      
-        
-          
-\section sec_setting_unix Setting up your project (Unix)
-We'll use \c autoconf and \c automake to make it simple to 
-create our build environment. Create a directory somewhere to 
-hold the code we're going to build. Create \c configure.in and 
-\c Makefile.am in that directory to get started.
-
-<tt>configure.in</tt>
-\verbatim
-dnl Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script.

-\section sec_running_test Running our tests
-
-We have a main that doesn't do anything. Let's start by adding the mecanics
-to run our tests (remember, test before you code ;-) ). For this example, 
-we will use a TextTestRunner with the CompilerOutputter for post-build 
-testing:
-
-<tt>MoneyApp.cpp</tt>
-\code
-#include "stdafx.h"
-#include <cppunit/CompilerOutputter.h>
-#include <cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.h>
-#include <cppunit/ui/text/TestRunner.h>
-
-
-int main(int argc, char* argv[])
-{
-  // Get the top level suite from the registry
-  CppUnit::Test *suite = CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry::getRegistry().makeTest();
-
-  // Adds the test to the list of test to run
-  CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner runner;
-  runner.addTest( suite );
-
-  // Change the default outputter to a compiler error format outputter
-  runner.setOutputter( new CppUnit::CompilerOutputter( &runner.result(),
-                                                       std::cerr ) );
-  // Run the tests.
-  bool wasSucessful = runner.run();
-
-  // Return error code 1 if the one of test failed.
-  return wasSucessful ? 0 : 1;
-}\endcode
-
-  VC++: Compile and run (Ctrl+F5).
-
-  Unix: First build. Since we don't have all the file yet, let's create them
-  and build our application for the first time:
-\verbatim
-touch Money.h MoneyTest.h MoneyTest.cpp
-aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal
-autoconf
-automake -a
-touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog # To make automake happy
-./configure
-make check\endverbatim
-
-  Our application will report that everything
-is fine and no test were run. So let's add some tests...
-
-
-
-\subsection sec_post_build Setting up automated post-build testing (VC++)
-
-What does post-build testing means? It means that each time you compile,
-the test are automatically run when the build finish. This is very
-useful, if you compile often you can know that you just 'broke' something,
-or that everything is still working fine.
-
-Let's adds that to our project, In the project settings, in the 
-'post-build step' tab:
-- Select 'All configurations' (upper left combo)
-- In the 'Post-build description', enter 'Unit testing...'
-- In 'post-build command(s)', add a new line: <tt>\$(TargetPath)$</tt>
-
-<tt>\$(TargetPath)</tt> expands into the name of your application:
-Debug\MoneyApp.exe in debug configuration and Release\MoneyApp.exe in release
-configuration.
-
-What we are doing is say to VC++ to run our application for each build. 
-Notices the last line of \c main(), it returns a different error code, 
-depending on weither or not a test failed. If the code returned by
-an application is not 0 in post-build step, it tell VC++ that the build
-step failed.
-
-Compile. Notices that the application's output is now in the build window.
-How convenient!
-

-\section sec_adding_testfixture Adding the TestFixture
-
-For this example, we are going to write a simple money class. Money
-has an amount and a currency. Let's begin by creating a fixture where
-we can put our tests, and add single test to test Money constructor:
-
-<tt>MoneyTest.h:</tt>
-\code
-#ifndef MONEYTEST_H
-#define MONEYTEST_H
-
-#include <cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h>
-
-class MoneyTest : public CppUnit::TestFixture
-{
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( MoneyTest );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST( testConstructor );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
-
-public:
-  void setUp();
-  void tearDown();
-
-  void testConstructor();
-};
-
-#endif  // MONEYTEST_H\endcode
-
-- CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE declares that our Fixture's test suite.
-- CPPUNIT_TEST adds a test to our test suite. The test is implemented 
-by a method named testConstructor().
-- setUp() and tearDown() are use to setUp/tearDown some fixtures. We are
-not using any for now.
-
-<tt>MoneyTest.cpp</tt>
-\code
-#include "stdafx.h"
-#include "MoneyTest.h"
-
-// Registers the fixture into the 'registry'
-CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION( MoneyTest );
-
-
-void 
-MoneyTest::setUp()
-{
-}
-
-
-void 
-MoneyTest::tearDown()
-{
-}
-
-
-void 
-MoneyTest::testConstructor()
-{
-  CPPUNIT_FAIL( "not implemented" );
-}
-\endcode
-
-Compile. As expected, it reports that a test failed. Press the \c F4 key
-(Go to next Error). VC++ jump right to our failed assertion CPPUNIT_FAIL.
-We can not ask better in term of integration!
-\verbatim
-Compiling...
-MoneyTest.cpp
-Linking...
-Unit testing...
-.F
-G:\prg\vc\Lib\cppunit\examples\money\MoneyTest.cpp(26):Assertion
-Test name: MoneyTest.testConstructor

-Failures !!!

-Error executing d:\winnt\system32\cmd.exe.
-
-moneyappd.exe - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
-\endverbatim
-
-Well, we have everything set up, let's start doing some real testing.
-
-
-  
-    
-      
-
-  
-\section sec_first_tests Our first tests
-
-Let's write our first real test. A test is usually decomposed in three parts:
-- setting up datas used by the test
-- doing some processing based on those datas
-- checking the result of the processing
-
-\code
-void 
-MoneyTest::testConstructor()
-{
-  // Set up
-  const std::string currencyFF( "FF" );
-  const double longNumber = 12345678.90123;
-
-  // Process
-  Money money( longNumber, currencyFF );
-
-  // Check
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL( longNumber, money.getAmount() );
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL( currencyFF, money.getCurrency() );
-}\endcode
-
-Well, we finally have a good start of what our Money class will
-look likes. Let's start implementing...
-
-<tt>Money.h</tt>
-\code
-#ifndef MONEY_H
-#define MONEY_H
-
-#include <string>
-
-class Money
-{
-public:
-  Money( double amount, std::string currency )
-    : m_amount( amount )
-    , m_currency( m_currency )
-  {
-  }
-
-  double getAmount() const
-  {
-    return m_amount;
-  }
-
-  std::string getCurrency() const
-  {
-    return m_currency;
-  }
-
-private:
-  double m_amount;
-  std::string m_currency;
-};
-
-#endif\endcode
-
-Include <tt>Money.h</tt> in MoneyTest.cpp and compile.
-
-Hum, an assertion failed! Press F4, and we jump to the assertion
-that checks the currency of the constructed money object. The report
-indicates that string is not equal to expected value. There is only
-two ways for this to happen: the member was badly initialized or we
-returned the wrong value. After a quick check, we fin out it is the former.
-Let's fix that:
-
-<tt>Money.h</tt>
-\code
-  Money( double amount, std::string currency )
-    : m_amount( amount )
-    , m_currency( currency )
-  {
-  }\endcode
-
-Compile. Our test finally pass!
-Let's add some functionnalities to our Money class.
-
-
-  
-    
-      
-        
-          
-            
-\section sec_more_tests Adding more tests
-
-\subsection sec_equal Testing for equality
-
-  We want to check if to Money object are equal. Let's start by adding
-a new test to the suite, then add our method:
-
-<tt>MoneyTest.h</tt>
-\code
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( MoneyTest );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST( testConstructor );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST( testEqual );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
-public:
-  ...
-  void testEqual();
-\endcode
-
-<tt>MoneyTest.cpp</tt>
-\code
-void
-MoneyTest::testEqual()
-{
-  // Set up
-  const Money money123FF( 123, "FF" );
-  const Money money123USD( 123, "USD" );
-  const Money money12FF( 12, "FF" );
-  const Money money12USD( 12, "USD" );
-
-  // Process & Check
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT( money123FF == money123FF );     // ==
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT( money12FF != money123FF );      // != amount
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT( money123USD != money123FF );    // != currency
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT( money12USD != money123FF );    // != currency and != amount
-}\endcode
-
-  Let's implements \c operator \c == and \c operator \c != in Money.h:
-
-<tt>Money.h</tt>
-\code
-class Money
-{
-public:
-...
-  bool operator ==( const Money &other ) const
-  {
-    return m_amount == other.m_amount  &&  
-           m_currency == other.m_currency;
-  }
-
-  bool operator !=( const Money &other ) const
-  {
-    return (*this == other);
-  }
-};
-\endcode
-
-  Compile, run... Ooops... Press F4, it seems we're having trouble 
-with \c operator \c !=. Let's fix that:
-\code
-  bool operator !=( const Money &other ) const
-  {
-    return !(*this == other);
-  }\endcode
-
-Compile, run. Finaly got it working!
-
-
-
-\subsection sec_opadd Adding moneys
-
-  Let's add our test 'testAdd' to MoneyTest. You know the routine...
-
-<tt>MoneyTest.cpp</tt>
-\code
-void 
-MoneyTest::testAdd()
-{
-  // Set up
-  const Money money12FF( 12, "FF" );
-  const Money expectedMoney( 135, "FF" );
-
-  // Process
-  Money money( 123, "FF" );
-  money += money12FF;
-
-  // Check
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL( expectedMoney == money.getAmount() );  // += works
-  CPPUNIT_ASSERT( &money == &(money += money12FF) );           // += returns ref. on 'this'.
-}\endcode
-
-  While writing that test case, you ask yourself, what is the result of
-adding money of currencies. Obviously this is an error and it should be
-reported, say let throw an exception, say \c IncompatibleMoneyError, 
-when the currencies are not equal. We will write another test case
-for this later. For now let get our testAdd() case working:
-
-<tt>Money.h</tt>
-\code
-class Money
-{
-public:
-...
-  Money &operator +=( const Money &other )
-  {
-    m_amount += other.m_amount;
-    return *this;
-  }
-}; \endcode
-
-Compile, run. Miracle, everything is fine! Just to be sure the test is indeed
-working, in the above code, change \c m_amount \c += to \c -=. Build and 
-check that it fails (always be suspicious of test that work the first 
-time: you may have forgotten to add it to the suite for example)! 
-Change the code back so that all the tests are working.
-  
-  Let's the incompatible money test case before we forget about it...
-That test case expect an \c IncompatibleMoneyError exception to be thrown. 
-%CppUnit can test that for us, you need to specify that the test case
-expect an exception when you add it to the suite:
-  
-<tt>MoneyTest.h</tt>
-\code
-class MoneyTest : public CppUnit::TestFixture
-{
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( MoneyTest );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST( testConstructor );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST( testEqual );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST( testAdd );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION( testAddThrow, IncompatibleMoneyError );
-  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
-public:
-  ...
-  void testAddThrow();
-};\endcode
-
-By convention, you ends the name of such tests with \c 'Throw', that way, you
-know that the test expect an exception to be thrown. Let's write our test case:
-
-<tt>MoneyTest.cpp</tt>
-\code
-void 
-MoneyTest::testAddThrow()
-{
-  // Set up
-  const Money money123FF( 123, "FF" );
-
-  // Process
-  Money money( 123, "USD" );
-  money += money123FF;        // should throw an exception
-}
-\endcode
-
-  Compile... Ooops, forgot to declare the exception class. Let's do that:
-
-<tt>Money.h</tt>
-\code
-#include <string>
-#include <stdexcept>
-
-class IncompatibleMoneyError : public std::runtime_error
-{
-public:
-  IncompatibleMoneyError() : runtime_error( "Incompatible moneys" )
-  {
-  }
-};
-\endcode
-
-  Compile. As expected testAddThrow() fail... Let's fix that:
-  
-<tt>Money.h</tt>
-\code
-  Money &operator +=( const Money &other )
-  {
-    if ( m_currency != other.m_currency )
-      throw IncompatibleMoneyError();
-
-    m_amount += other.m_amount;
-    return *this;
-  }\endcode
-
-  Compile. Our test finaly pass!

-/*! \page cppunit_cookbook CppUnit Cookbook
-Here is a short cookbook to help you get started.
-
-
-\section simple_test_case Simple Test Case
-You want to know whether your code is working. 
-
-How do you do it? 
-
-There are many ways. Stepping through a debugger or 
-littering your code with stream output calls are two of 
-the simpler ways, but they both have drawbacks.
-Stepping through your code is a good idea, but it 
-is not automatic. You have to do it every time you
-make changes. Streaming out text is also fine, 
-but it makes code ugly and it generates far more 
-information than you need most of the time.
-
-Tests in %CppUnit can be run automatically. 
-They are easy to set up and once you have 
-written them, they are always there to help 
-you keep confidence in the quality of your code.
-
-To make a simple test, here is what you do:
-
-Subclass the \link CppUnit::TestCase TestCase \endlink class. 
-Override the method \link CppUnit::TestCase::runTest() runTest()\endlink. 
-When you want to check a value, call 
-\link CPPUNIT_ASSERT() CPPUNIT_ASSERT(bool) \endlink
-and pass in an expression that is true if the 
-test succeeds. 
-
-For example, to test the equality comparison 
-for a Complex number class, write:
-
-\code
-class ComplexNumberTest : public CppUnit::TestCase { 
-public: 
-  ComplexNumberTest( std::string name ) : CppUnit::TestCase( name ) {}
-  
-  void runTest() {
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( Complex (10, 1) == Complex (10, 1) );
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( !(Complex (1, 1) == Complex (2, 2)) );
-  }
-};
-\endcode
-
-That was a very simple test. Ordinarily, 
-you'll have many little test cases that you'll 
-want to run on the same set of objects. To do 
-this, use a fixture.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-\section fixture Fixture
-A fixture is a known set of objects that 
-serves as a base for a set of test cases. 
-Fixtures come in very handy when you are 
-testing as you develop. 
-
-Let's try out this style of development and 
-learn about fixtures along the away. Suppose 
-that we are really developing a complex 
-number class. Let's start by defining a 
-empty class named Complex.
-
-\code
-class Complex {};
-\endcode
-
-Now create an instance of ComplexNumberTest 
-above, compile the code and see what happens. 
-The first thing we notice is a few compiler 
-errors. The test uses <tt>operator ==</tt>, but it is 
-not defined. Let's fix that.
-
-\code
-bool operator==( const Complex &a, const Complex &b) 
-{ 
-  return true; 
-}
-\endcode
-
-Now compile the test, and run it. This time it 
-compiles but the test fails. 
-We need a bit more to get an <tt>operator ==</tt>working 
-correctly, so we revisit the code.
-
-\code
-class Complex { 
-  friend bool operator ==(const Complex& a, const Complex& b);
-  double real, imaginary;
-public:
-  Complex( double r, double i = 0 ) 
-    : real(r)
-	, imaginary(i) 
-  {
-  }
-};
-
-bool operator ==( const Complex &a, const Complex &b )
-{ 
-  return a.real == b.real  &&  a.imaginary == b.imaginary; 
-}
-\endcode
-
-If we compile now and run our test it will pass. 
-
-Now we are ready to add new operations and 
-new tests. At this point a fixture would be 
-handy. We would probably be better off when 
-doing our tests if we decided to instantiate 
-three or four complex numbers and reuse them 
-across our tests. 
-
-Here is how we do it:
-- Add member variables for each part of the 
-  \link CppUnit::TestFixture fixture \endlink
-- Override \link CppUnit::TestFixture::setUp() setUp() \endlink
-  to initialize the variables
-- Override \link CppUnit::TestFixture::tearDown() tearDown() \endlink
-  to release any permanent resources you allocated in 
-  \link CppUnit::TestFixture::setUp() setUp() \endlink
-
-\code
-class ComplexNumberTest : public CppUnit::TestFixture {
-private:
-  Complex *m_10_1, *m_1_1, *m_11_2;
-public:
-  void setUp()
-  {
-    m_10_1 = new Complex( 10, 1 );
-    m_1_1 = new Complex( 1, 1 );
-    m_11_2 = new Complex( 11, 2 );  
-  }
-
-  void tearDown() 
-  {
-    delete m_10_1;
-    delete m_1_1;
-    delete m_11_2;
-  }
-};
-\endcode
-
-Once we have this fixture, we can add the complex 
-addition test case any any others that we need 
-over the course of our development.
-
-
-
-\section test_case Test Case
-
-How do you write and invoke individual tests using a fixture? 
-
-There are two steps to this process:
-- Write the test case as a method in the fixture class
-- Create a TestCaller which runs that particular method
-
-Here is our test case class with a few extra case methods:
-
-\code
-class ComplexNumberTest : public CppUnit::TestFixture  {
-private:
-  Complex *m_10_1, *m_1_1, *m_11_2;
-public:
-  void setUp()
-  {
-    m_10_1 = new Complex( 10, 1 );
-    m_1_1 = new Complex( 1, 1 );
-    m_11_2 = new Complex( 11, 2 );  
-  }
-
-  void tearDown() 
-  {
-    delete m_10_1;
-    delete m_1_1;
-    delete m_11_2;
-  }
-
-  void testEquality()
-  {
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( *m_10_1 == *m_10_1 );
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( !(*m_10_1 == *m_11_2) );
-  }
-
-  void testAddition()
-  {
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( *m_10_1 + *m_1_1 == *m_11_2 );
-  }
-};
-\endcode
-
-One may create and run instances for each test case like this:
-
-\code
-CppUnit::TestCaller<ComplexNumberTest> test( "testEquality", 
-                                             &ComplexNumberTest::testEquality );
-CppUnit::TestResult result;
-test.run( &result );
-\endcode
-
-The second argument to the test caller constructor is the address of 
-a method on ComplexNumberTest. When the test caller is run, 
-that specific method will be run.  This is not a useful thing to do, 
-however, as no diagnostics will be displayed.  
-One will normally use a \link ExecutingTest TestRunner \endlink (see below) 
-to display the results.
-
-Once you have several tests, organize them into a suite.
-
-
-
-
-
-\section suite Suite
-
-How do you set up your tests so that you can run them all at once?
-
-%CppUnit provides a \link CppUnit::TestSuite TestSuite \endlink class 
-that runs any number of TestCases together. 
-
-We saw, above, how to run a single test case.
-
-To create a suite of two or more tests, you do the following:
-
-\code
-CppUnit::TestSuite suite;
-CppUnit::TestResult result;
-suite.addTest( new CppUnit::TestCaller<ComplexNumberTest>(
-                       "testEquality", 
-                       &ComplexNumberTest::testEquality ) );
-suite.addTest( new CppUnit::TestCaller<ComplexNumberTest>(
-                       "testAddition", 
-                       &ComplexNumberTest::testAddition ) );
-suite.run( &result );
-\endcode         
-
-\link CppUnit::TestSuite TestSuites \endlink don't only have to 
-contain callers for TestCases.  They can contain any object 
-that implements the \link CppUnit::Test Test \endlink interface.
-For example, you can create a 
-\link CppUnit::TestSuite TestSuite \endlink in your code and
-I can create one in mine, and we can run them together 
-by creating a \link CppUnit::TestSuite TestSuite \endlink 
-that contains both:
-
-\code
-CppUnit::TestSuite suite;
-CppUnit::TestResult result;
-suite.addTest( ComplexNumberTest::suite() );
-suite.addTest( SurrealNumberTest::suite() );
-suite.run( &result );
-\endcode
-
-
-
-
-\section test_runner TestRunner
-
-How do you run your tests and collect their results?
-
-Once you have a test suite, you'll want to run it. %CppUnit provides tools 
-to define the suite to be run and to display its results. 
-You make your suite accessible to a \link ExecutingTest TestRunner \endlink
-program with a static method <I>suite</I> that returns a test suite.
-
-For example, to make a ComplexNumberTest suite available to a 
-\link ExecutingTest TestRunner \endlink, add the following code to 
-ComplexNumberTest:
-
-\code
-public: 
-  static CppUnit::Test *suite()
-  {
-    CppUnit::TestSuite *suiteOfTests = new CppUnit::TestSuite( "ComplexNumberTest" );
-    suiteOfTests->addTest( new CppUnit::TestCaller<ComplexNumberTest>( 
-                                   "testEquality", 
-                                   &ComplexNumberTest::testEquality ) );
-    suiteOfTests->addTest( new CppUnit::TestCaller<ComplexNumberTest>(
-                                   "testAddition",
-                                   &ComplexNumberTest::testAddition ) );
-    return suiteOfTests;
-  }
-\endcode
-
-\anchor test_runner_code
-To use the text version, include the header files for the tests in Main.cpp:
-
-\code
-#include <cppunit/ui/text/TestRunner.h>
-#include "ExampleTestCase.h"
-#include "ComplexNumberTest.h"
-\endcode
-
-And add a call to 
-\link ::CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner::addTest addTest(CppUnit::Test *) \endlink 
-in the <tt>main()</tt> function:
-
-\code
-int main( int argc, char **argv)
-{
-  CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner runner;
-  runner.addTest( ExampleTestCase::suite() );
-  runner.addTest( ComplexNumberTest::suite() );
-  runner.run();
-  return 0;
-}
-\endcode
-
-The \link ExecutingTest TestRunner \endlink will run the tests. 
-If all the tests pass, you'll get an informative message. 
-If any fail, you'll get the following information:
-
-- The name of the test case that failed
-- The name of the source file that contains the test
-- The line number where the failure occurred
-- All of the text inside the call to CPPUNIT_ASSERT() which detected the failure
-
-%CppUnit distinguishes between <I>failures</I> and <I>errors</I>. A failure is 
-anticipated and checked for with assertions. Errors are unanticipated problems 
-like division by zero and other exceptions thrown by the C++ runtime or your code.
-
-
-
-
-\section helper_macros Helper Macros
-
-As you might have noticed, implementing the fixture static <tt>suite()</tt> 
-method is a repetitive and error prone task. A \ref WritingTestFixture set of 
-macros have been created to automatically implements the 
-static <tt>suite()</tt> method.
-
-The following code is a rewrite of ComplexNumberTest using those macros:
-
-\code
-#include <cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h>
-
-class ComplexNumberTest : public CppUnit::TestFixture  {
-\endcode
-First, we declare the suite, passing the class name to the macro:
-\code
-CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( ComplexNumberTest );
-\endcode
-The suite created by the static <tt>suite()</tt> method is named after 
-the class name.
-Then, we declare each test case of the fixture:
-\code
-CPPUNIT_TEST( testEquality );
-CPPUNIT_TEST( testAddition );
-\endcode
-Finally, we end the suite declaration:
-\code
-CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
-\endcode
-At this point, a method with the following signature has been implemented:
-\code
-static CppUnit::TestSuite *suite();
-\endcode
-The rest of the fixture is left unchanged:
-\code
-private:
-  Complex *m_10_1, *m_1_1, *m_11_2;
-public:
-  void setUp()
-  {
-    m_10_1 = new Complex( 10, 1 );
-    m_1_1 = new Complex( 1, 1 );
-    m_11_2 = new Complex( 11, 2 );  
-  }
-
-  void tearDown() 
-  {
-    delete m_10_1;
-    delete m_1_1;
-    delete m_11_2;
-  }
-
-  void testEquality()
-  {
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( *m_10_1 == *m_10_1 );
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( !(*m_10_1 == *m_11_2) );
-  }
-
-  void testAddition()
-  {
-    CPPUNIT_ASSERT( *m_10_1 + *m_1_1 == *m_11_2 );
-  }
-};
-\endcode
-
-The name of the \link CppUnit::TestCaller TestCaller \endlink added to the
-suite are a composition of the fixture name and the method name. 
-
-In the present case, the names would be:
-"ComplexNumberTest.testEquality" and "ComplexNumberTest.testAddition".
-
-The \link WritingTestFixture helper macros \endlink help you write comon assertion.
-For example, to check that ComplexNumber throws a MathException when dividing
-a number by 0:
-- add the test to the suite using CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION, specifying the expected
-  exception type.
-- write the test case method
-
-\code
-CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( ComplexNumberTest );
-// [...]
-CPPUNIT_TEST_EXCEPTION( testDivideByZeroThrows, MathException );
-CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
-
-// [...]
-
-  void testDivideByZeroThrows()
-  {
-    // The following line should throw a MathException.
-    *m_10_1 / ComplexNumber(0);
-  }
-\endcode
-
-If the expected exception is not thrown, then a assertion failure is reported.
-
-
-
-
-\section test_factory_registry TestFactoryRegistry
-
-The TestFactoryRegistry was created to solve two pitfalls:
-- forgetting to add your fixture suite to the test runner (since it is in 
-  another file, it is easy to forget)
-- compilation bottleneck caused by the inclusion of all test case headers 
-  (see \ref test_runner_code "previous example")
-
-The TestFactoryRegistry is a place where suites can be registered at initialization
-time.
-
-To register the ComplexNumber suite, in the .cpp file, you add:
-
-\code
-#include <cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h>
-
-CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION( ComplexNumberTest );
-\endcode
-
-Behind the scene, a static variable type of 
-\link CppUnit::AutoRegisterSuite AutoRegisterSuite \endlink is declared.
-On construction, it will 
-\link CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry::registerFactory(TestFactory*) register \endlink 
-a \link CppUnit::TestSuiteFactory TestSuiteFactory \endlink into the 
-\link CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry TestFactoryRegistry \endlink. 
-The \link CppUnit::TestSuiteFactory TestSuiteFactory \endlink returns
-the \link CppUnit::TestSuite TestSuite \endlink returned by ComplexNumber::suite().
-
-To run the tests, using the text test runner, we don't need to include the fixture
-anymore:
-
-\code
-#include <cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.h>
-#include <cppunit/ui/text/TestRunner.h>
-
-int main( int argc, char **argv)
-{
-  CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner runner;
-\endcode
-First, we retreive the instance of the 
-\link CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry TestFactoryRegistry \endlink:
-\code
-  CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry &registry = CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry::getRegistry();
-\endcode
-Then, we obtain and add a new \link CppUnit::TestSuite TestSuite \endlink created 
-by the  \link CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry TestFactoryRegistry \endlink that 
-contains all the test suite registered using CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION().
-\code
-  runner.addTest( registry.makeTest() );
-  runner.run();
-  return 0;
-}
-\endcode
-
-
-
-
-\section post_build_check Post-build check
-
-Well, now that we have our unit tests running, how about integrating unit 
-testing to our build process ?
-
-To do that, the application must returns a value different than 0 to indicate that
-there was an error.
-
-\link CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner::run() TestRunner::run() \endlink returns 
-a boolean indicating if the run was successful.
-
-Updating our main programm, we obtains:
-\code
-#include <cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.h>
-#include <cppunit/ui/text/TestRunner.h>
-
-int main( int argc, char **argv)
-{
-  CppUnit::TextUi::TestRunner runner;
-  CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry &registry = CppUnit::TestFactoryRegistry::getRegistry();
-  runner.addTest( registry.makeTest() );
-  bool wasSuccessful = runner.run( "", false );
-  return wasSuccessful;
-}
-\endcode
-
-Now, you need to run your application after compilation.
-
-With Visual C++, this is done in <em>Project Settings/Post-Build step</em>, 
-by adding the following command: <tt>$(TargetPath)</tt>. It is expanded to 
-the application executable path. Look up the project 
-<tt>examples/cppunittest/CppUnitTestMain.dsp</tt> which
-use that technic.

- \section _history History
- The first port of JUnit to C++ was done
- by Michael Feathers. His versions
- can be found on the 
- <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">
- XProgramming software page</a>. They are os-specific,
- so Jerome Lacoste provided a port to Unix/Solaris.
- His version can be found on the same page.
- The %CppUnit project has combined and built on this work.
-
- \section _usage Usage
- Take a look into the \ref cppunit_cookbook.
- It gives a quick start into using this 
- testing framework. <a href="modules.html">Modules</a> give
- you a organized view of %CppUnit classes.
-
- (Notes to newbies, you may want to check out \ref money_example,
- a work in progress, but the project is provided with %CppUnit).
-
- For a discussion on %CppUnit, check 
- <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CppUnit">
- the WikiWiki Pages on CppUnit</a>. There you can also
- find the original versions and various ports to other
- OSses and languages.

-/*! \defgroup WritingTestPlugIn Writing Test Plug-in
- *
- * Creating a test plug-in is really simple:
- * - make your project a dynamic library (with VC++, choose Win32 Dynamic Library in
- *   the project wizard), and link against the dynamic library version of %CppUnit
- *   (cppunit*_dll.lib for VC++).
- * - in a cpp file, include TestPlugIn.h, and use the macro CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT()
- *   to declare the test plug-in.
- * - That's it, you're done! All the tests registered using the TestFactoryRegistry,
- *   CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_NAMED_REGISTRATION, or CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION will
- *   be visible to other plug-in and to the DllPlugInRunner.
- *
- * Example:
- * \code
- * #include <cppunit/include/plugin/TestPlugIn.h>
- *
- * CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT();
- * \endcode
- *
- * The interface CppUnitTestPlugIn is automatically implemented by the previous
- * macro. You can define your one implementation.
- *
- * To provide your custom implementation of the plug-in interface, you must:
- * - create a class that implements the CppUnitTestPlugIn interface
- * - use CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_EXPORTED_FUNCTION_IMPL() with your class to export
- *   the plug-in interface
- * - implements the 'main' function with CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT_MAIN().
- *
- * Some of the reason you may want to do this:
- * - You do not use the TestFactoryRegistry to register your test.
- * - You want to create a custom listener to use with DllPlugInRunner.
- * - You want to do initialize some globale resources before running the test
- *   (setting up COM for example).
- *   
- * See CppUnitTestPlugIn for further detail on how to do this.
- *
- * Creating your own test plug-in with VC++:
- * - Create a new "Win32 Dynamic Library" project, choose the empty template
- * - For the Debug Configuration, add cppunitd_dll.lib to 
- *   'Project Settings/Link/Object/Libariries modules', and for the Release
- *   Configuration, add cppunit_dll.lib.
- * - For All Configuration, in 'C++/Preprocessor/Preprocessors definitions',
- *   add the symbol 'CPPUNIT_DLL' at the end of the line (it means that
- *   you are linking against cppunit dll).
- * - Create a 'main' file that contains:
-\verbatim
-#include <cppunit/plugin/TestPlugIn.h>
-
-CPPUNIT_PLUGIN_IMPLEMENT();\endverbatim
- * - Add your tests
- * - You're done !
- *
- * See examples/simple/simple_plugin.dsp for an example.
- *
- * Notes to VC++ users: 
- * - you can run a post-build check on the plug-in. Add the following line to your
- *   post-build tab: "DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe $(TargetPath)". DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe
- *   need to be some place were it can be found (path, ...), or you need to
- *   indicate the correct path. 
- *   $(TargetPath) is the filename of your plug-in.
- * - you can debug your DLL, set the executable for debug session to the plug-in 
- *   runner, and the name of the DLL in the program arguments ($(xxx) won't work
- *   this time).
- *
- * How does it works ?
- *
- * When %CppUnit is linked as a DLL, the singleton used for the TestFactoryRegistry
- * is the same for the plug-in runner (also linked against %CppUnit DLL). This means
- * that the tests registered with the macros (at static initialization) are 
- * registered in the same registry. As soon as a DLL is loaded by the PlugInManager,
- * the DLL static variable are constructed and the test registered to the 
- * TestFactoryRegistry.
- *
- * After loading the DLL, the PlugInManager look-up a specific function exported by
- * the DLL. That function returns a pointer on the plug-in interface, which is later
- * used by the PlugInManager.
- *
- * \see CreatingTestSuite.

-A test plug-ins that track tests and test suites running time. It demonstrates
-TestListener, TestPlugIn, and XmlOutputterHook.
-
-Both suite and test case times are tracked. The plug-in include in the XML
-output the TestPath of each test cases and its tracked time.
-
-The timed test hierarchy is also included in the XML output. This way it is
-possible to see the time each suite takes to run.
-
-
-
-* Usage:
-
-Just add this plug-in to DllPlugInTester command line. It will add a test 
-listener to track test time, and add a hook to the XmlOutputter to include
-test time to the XmlOutput.
-
-If the option "text" is passed to the plug-in, the timed test tree will be
-printed to stdout.
-
-DllPlugInRunnerd.exe ClockerPlugInd.dll
-or
-DllPlugInRunnerd.exe ClockerPlugInd.dll=text
-
-* Example:
-
-DllPlugInTesterd_dll.exe -x timed.xml ClockerPlugInd.dll CppUnitTestPlugInd.dll 
-
-Will track time of all tests contains in CppUnitTestPlugInd.dll and save the
-result in timed.xml.
-
-* Notes:
-
-The id of the <TimedTestTree> are different than those of the
-<SuccessfulTests> and <FailedTests> trees. You can use the <TestPath> to 
-cross-reference the datas.
-
-* Remarks:
-
-You may want to review ClockerModel before using this plug-in for serious
-purpose, add timing based on the process cpu time.
-
-A version is provided for NT that use the main thread cpu time. This is an issue 
-if the test cases are multithreaded.
