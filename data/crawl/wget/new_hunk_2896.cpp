   Uses malloc to allocate space for command and value.
   If the line is invalid, data is freed and 0 is returned.

   Returns one of line_ok, line_empty, line_syntax_error, or
   line_unknown_command.

   In case of line_ok, *COM and *VAL point to freshly allocated
   strings, and *COMIND points to com's index.  In case of error or
   empty line, their values are unmodified.  */
