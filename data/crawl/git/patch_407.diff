 Git 2.11 Release Notes
 ======================
 
+Backward compatibility notes.
+
+ * An empty string used as a pathspec element has always meant
+   'everything matches', but it is too easy to write a script that
+   finds a path to remove in $path and run 'git rm "$paht"', which
+   ends up removing everything.  This release starts warning about the
+   use of an empty string that is used for 'everything matches' and
+   asks users to use a more explicit '.' for that instead.
+
+   The hope is that existing users will not mind this change, and
+   eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error, upgrading
+   the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.
+
+
+ * The historical argument order "git merge <msg> HEAD <commit>..."
+   has been deprecated for quite some time, and will be removed in the
+   next release (not this one).

+ * Comes with new version of git-gui, now at its 0.21.0 tag.

  * "git format-patch --cover-letter HEAD^" to format a single patch
    with a separate cover letter now numbers the output as [PATCH 0/1]
    and [PATCH 1/1] by default.

  * "git mergetool" learned to honor "-O<orderfile>" to control the

+ * "git diff/log --ws-error-highlight=<kind>" lacked the corresponding
+   configuration variable to set it by default.
+
+ * "git ls-files" learned "--recurse-submodules" option that can be
+   used to get a listing of tracked files across submodules (i.e. this
+   only works with "--cached" option, not for listing untracked or
+   ignored files).  This would be a useful tool to sit on the upstream
+   side of a pipe that is read with xargs to work on all working tree
+   files from the top-level superproject.
+
+ * A new credential helper that talks via "libsecret" with
+   implementations of XDG Secret Service API has been added to
+   contrib/credential/.
+
+ * The GPG verification status shown in "%G?" pretty format specifier
+   was not rich enough to differentiate a signature made by an expired
+   key, a signature made by a revoked key, etc.  New output letters
+   have been assigned to express them.
+
+ * In addition to purely abbreviated commit object names, "gitweb"
+   learned to turn "git describe" output (e.g. v2.9.3-599-g2376d31787)
+   into clickable links in its output.
