This patch contains rework of existing dpdkstat plugin. Changes are focused on
extracting common dpdk related features into utils file that could be reused by
other DPDK plugins. Also some related structural changes are introduced.

List of changes:
- introduction of new utils_dpdk.c that handles child process spawning,
  and terminating, messaging between parent and child, DPDK configuration
  and initialization and DPDK commands execution
- DPDK EAL specific options put into separate subsection of
  dpdkstat configuration
- documentation update

Those changes are preparatory steps for upstreaming dpdkevent plugin
that is going to collect DPDK ports and logical cores status info.

This patch enables support to retrieve statistics for DPDK
interfaces. An overview of the threading is as follows:
1. collectd init() or read() calls dpdk_helper_spawn() to retrieve
   the required size of xstats to allocate.
   1.1. DPDK counts ports, stats and length, writing them to
        shared-memory (SHM).
   1.2. DPDK helper (secondary) process quits, allowing cleanup of
        the shared memory.
2. collectd resizes shared-memory to size of stats as provided by
   DPDK.
3. collectd respawns the DPDK helper.
   3.1. Helper blocks on a semaphore until told to read the stats
        from DPDK and write them to SHM.
4. collectd dispatches statistics
   4.1. Thread blocks on semaphore until stats are available.
This threading model is required to allow the plugin to detect when
the DPDK primary process/application has been killed/reset, and to avoid
the plugin from stopping another DPDK primary process from starting.
Some extra housekeeping is in place to ensure collectd is never
stalled by using sem_timedwait() with a timeout. If collectd dies, the
helper process will automatically quit after a timeout, as it detects
its ppid has changed.

Hi all!

I've created a patch that enables collectd to collect all irqs present in
/proc/interrupts, with numeric and string names (NMI, LOC, RES, etc).

Two notices:
a) Unfortunately I was unable to build collectd from git repo (build.sh
   failures), therefore I created this patch for latest stable release: 4.10.1
b) I am fairly unexperienced in C programming, so please inform me gently of my
   mistakes:) But I am already using a patched version and it works fine.

Any feedback on code quality or recommendations are welcome.

no easy way to work with unix sockets from the shell, so if someone
wanted to flush collectd without this program, they would need to do it
through some other language (or restart the deamon).

Hi!

I attach here a patch which adds Timeout option in configuration file.
This option is global (i.e. at the same level as Interval) and it's
the max number of intervals that a package can be missed before a
missing notification would be raised. By dafault collectd wait 2
intervals and it's a hardcoded value AFAIK, if plugin cannot get data
for more than 2 intervals, then (if it's an interesting value),
collectd send a missing notification. Setting Timeout to an high value
you can be more tolerant with that missing.

It's usefull on large networks. In my case, the company LAN is
distributed on distant locations and sometimes (due to network issues)
UDP packages are lost, I use the Timeout to be more tolerant to this
networks fails. For example setting Internval to 10 and Timeout to 6,
a  missing notification will be raised only if none data was reported
in last 60s.

I hope that things explained well enough, and (who knows!) maybe this
could be usefull to anybody ;)

  Andrés

Within the client handling thread, fdopen is called twice on the file
descriptor passed to the thread. Later those file handles are closed like:

  fclose (fhin);
  fclose (fhout);

This is a race condition, because the first call to fclose will close the file
descriptor. The second call to fclose will try the same. Usually, it would fail
silently and all is well. On a busy machine, however, another thread may just
have opened a file or accepted a socket. In that case an arbitrary file
descriptor is closed. If the file descriptor is opened yet again fast enough,
data may even end up in a totally wrong location.

As a work-around the file descriptor is not dup'ed so each fdopen operates on
its own file descriptor. As an alternative the ""r+"" mode and a single file
handle may be suitable, too.

Hi,

i was thinking how to ""spread out"" writes to rrd files a bit, because
now its big spike every CacheTimeout or little smaller ""square"" on
graph if u use WritesPerSecond. So ive written little patch which
""spreads out"" writing by changing Cache timeout every time rrdtool
plugin finds data to save. Basically instead of moving data older than
CacheTimeout to write queue it moves it if its older than CacheTimeout
+- RandomTimeout. What it changes?

Without it, gathered data is ""synchronised"" with eachother, for
example (CacheTimeout = 600):
1.collectd starts
2. after 10 minutes, data from all plugins get ""too old"" and get
pushed into write queue and get saved
3. after another 10 minutes, same thing, all data ""ages"" at same time
and get saved in one big chunk

With it (RandomTimeout=300) it works like that
1. collectd starts
2. after 5 minutes some data (lets call it A) starts to go into write queue
3. after 10 minutes from start about 50% (on average) data is saved
(lets call it B)
4. finally, after 15 minutes, all ""leftover"" data gets saved (lets call it C)
5. next ""cycle""
6. data A ages first (cos it was put to disk first) and like before,
some of it gets writen earlier, some of it gets written later)
7. after that data B ages and like before writes are spread over 10 mins
8. same with C

so first cycle (looking at i/o) looks like sinus, next 10 minute cycle
is same sinus but flattened a bit and so on (looks like fading sinus),
and after few cycles it gives pretty much same amount on writes per
sec, no ugly spikes.
Effect looks like that:

(after few more h it will be more ""smooth"")

Add support for new meta selections allowing addition of graphs
with wildcard behavior.
This adds support for @all selection which matches any values

In addition those types for which meta graphs exist now also list the
individual type instances in addition to the meta graph key for separate
graphing.

In order to support such new groups the lookup code has been refactored
to use a single scanning function which recursively traveses the
collectd RRD output directory for hosts, plugins, types and passing the
discovered data to callback functions for use. The callbacks returns
true to indicate traversal should continue on to next depth level and
false to tell it to continue with next element.
e.g. true on a host means it should look for plugins for given host,
false to continue with next host.

Hi,

Attached is a patch with a set of PHP files for a complete graphing
environment for collectd-generated RRDs.
Before generating a graph with rrdtool it can tell collectd to flush
the RRDs that are about to be used.

The interface is built with dynamic HTML.
It provides following options:
 - host selection
 -> plugin selection
 --> plugin instance selection
 ---> type selection
 ----> type instance selection (or meta graph)
 - linear / logarithmic Y-scale
 - verbose / minimal legend
 - [Add Graph] [Remove all Graphs] [Refresh Graphs]
For each displayed graph:
 - Move above previous graph
 - Refresh graph
 - Remove graph
 - Move below following graph

I tested on following browsers:
- Firefox-3.0
- Safari-3.2 (Win32)
- Konqueror (KDE-4.1.3)
- Webkit (webkit-gtk-0_p40220)
- Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8rc - CSS layout issues with <8)

Dependencies:
- PHP-5 (might run with PHP-4)
  > GD suport for error images
  > Ability to execute rrdtool binary
  > Unix socket for FLUSH support
- RRDTool (rrdtool graph, rrdtool info)

TODO: complete/improve graph definitions in definitions.php
 though there is code to generate basic graph for any RRD of
 unknown type, so definitions are rather a matter of color,
 DS combination and stacking.

Florian Forster wrote:
> Just out of curiosity: Why don't hostnames work for you?

For guests there's the question of what we put in the hostname field. The
previous plugin (libvirtstats) puts the guest's name in this field, but there
are some problems with this:

   physicalserver1 <--- (hostname of physical server)
     |
      \--- database <--- (name of guest)
      \--- web

   physicalserver2
     |
      \--- database
      \--- web

   coldbackupserver
     |
     (no guests)

Guest names aren't really unique. Different physical servers may have guests
with overlapping names as in the example above. Also guest names aren't fixed.
Xen in particular renames guests at will. For example if a guest is about to
migrate then Xen renames the guest as 'migrating-foo' and if the guest is about
to shutdown Xen renames it as 'Zombie-foo'. The administrator of the physical
server can also rename guests.

While you're migrating you'll have an intermediate situation like this:

   physicalserver1
     |
      \--- migrating-database
      \--- migrating-web     |
                             | migration
   coldbackupserver          |
     |                       V
      \--- database
      \--- web

During live migrations the old instance ('migrating-foo') is still running.

The UUID is unique across physical servers, and is copied by migration and
preserved across shutdowns so if you care about which guest your stats ""really""
came from then only the UUID tells you this.

Guests also have a hostname which is separate from the guest's name (the
guest's name is stored in the hypervisor, the hostname is stored inside the
guest's kernel). However it's not feasible to access the guest's hostname from
the hypervisor since this would involve some sort of snooping into the guest
kernel. The guest might be running Windows or FreeBSD etc. The only feasible
way to get this is to run an instance of collectd inside each guest, but then
the uuid plugin will also work in this scenario and can get the UUID since it
is exposed inside the guest either through an emulated BIOS or in
/sys/hypervisor/uuid.

Rich.

I've looked into your plugin in more detail just now and fixed the
following issues:
- Moved the RRD-files into a subdirectory called `irq'. That's how it's
  going to be done in the next major version.
- Renamed the DS to `value' and set the maximum value to 65535. I'm not
  sure if this maximum value is big enough..?
- Don't use `LOG_EMERG' when config-problems are found. Rather, print to
  `STDERR' since it's still available during configuration.
- Use `strsplit' when parsing `/proc/interrupts'. This makes much of the
  pointer-arithmetic obsolete and the code much more readable.
- The device names are not used in the filename, though I'm not certain
  if that's the way to go here.. On my workstation there is a line like
  this:
    193:      28492   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd, ehci_hcd
  Apparently the interrupt is shared among several USB-controllers. My
  problem here is, that as soon as one device is deactivated or the
  order changes, so does the filename. Besides, a filename along the
  lines of `irq-193-uhci_hcd-ehci_hcd.rrd' would be nice.
  On another machine I have this line:
    217:   50173955          0   IO-APIC-level  3ware Storage Controller
  Where one device somehow manages to write a _description_ in there.
  This makes detection of such shared interrupts as above tricky.

  filename, please let me know.",113,data/crawl/collectd/patch_234.diff

This plugin collects email count and size for each type (e.g. ham, spam,
virus, ...) of emails, spam score values and the count of successful spam
checks (e.g.  BAYES_99, SUBJECT_DRUG_GAP_C, ...).

These information are provided by external programs which communicate with the
plugin thru a UNIX socket and a simple line-based protocol:

/* e-mail type (e.g. ham, spam, virus, ...) and size */
e:<type>:<bytes>

/* spam score */
s:<value>

/* successful spam checks */
c:<type1>[,<type2>,...]

At most MAX_CONNS (currently set to 5) clients can connect to the plugin
simultaneously. Each connection is handled by a separate thread. Any input
line is limited to 256 characters (including the newline character) which
ought to be enough for anybody[tm] by definition. ""c""-lines have to be split
up if they grow longer.
