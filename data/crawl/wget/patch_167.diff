-		   GNU Wget Installation Procedure
-                   ===============================
-
-0. Introduction
----------------
-
-This document describes how to build Wget from source code on
-Unix-like systems.  If you want to install a precompiled Wget, this
-document is not for you -- refer to the documentation provided by the
-distributors instead.  If you already have Wget and want to learn how
-to use it, refer to Wget's Info documentation or man page which you
-should have received with your system.  If you are using Windows
-(except for Cygwin), read windows/README instead.  If you want to
-compile Wget from source code on a Unix-like system, read on.
-
-The preferred form of building Wget is to get a release archive and
-unpack it (which you have presumably done, since you are reading
-this).  If you have obtained the source code via the Mercurial
-repository, please follow the instructions in `README.checkout' before
-continuing, as the sources from the Mercurial repository do not include
-some files that are present in official distributions; these additional
-files must be generated first.
-
-1. Dependencies
----------------
-
-To build Wget, your system must support a Unix-like command-line
-development environment, including the text-processing utilities (sh,
-grep, awk, sed, etc.) and a functional C compiler.  On some GNU/Linux
-systems, this means that you will need to install packages such as
-`gcc', `glibc-devel' (or `libc6-dev') and `make'.  Most systems come
-with these packages preinstalled, but it doesn't hurt to check.  If
-you have successfully compiled other software from source, you
-probably have them all.
-
-In addition to the C development environment, Wget can use a number of
-optional libraries to provide additional features, such as translated
-messages and support for "https" URLs.  The "external" dependencies
-include:
-
-  - OpenSSL -- for "https" URLs.
-  - GNU gettext -- for translated messages.
-  - GNU libidn -- for IDN/IRI support.
-  - GNU libiconv -- for IDN/IRI support (not needed on GNU).
-
-To be usable for building Wget, the listed libraries must be installed
-with their "development" header files.  On GNU/Linux systems this
-typically means installing the corredponsing "lib<name>-devel" or
-"lib<name>-dev" package along with the package with "lib<name>".
-
-2. Configuration
-----------------
-
-Before compiling Wget, you need to "configure" it using the
-`configure' script provided with the distribution.  Configuration
-serves two distinct purposes: it enables Wget's build system to
-inspect certain features of your operating system for more robust
-compilation, and it enables you to choose which features you want the
-resulting Wget to have.
-
-As is the case with most GNU software, Wget's configure script was
-generated with GNU Autoconf.  If you're not familiar with
-Autoconf-generated scripts, read on.
-
-The most straightforward way to configure Wget is by running the
-configure script without any arguments.  After running some
-compilation-related tests, it will create the Makefiles needed to
-build Wget.  However, you may wish to customize Wget's configuration
-by providing arguments to `configure'.  Wget's configure script
-accepts standard Autoconf arguments, the most important ones being:
-
-  --help                  display a help message and exit
-
-  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
-                          (/usr/local by default)
-  --bindir=DIR            user executables in DIR (PREFIX/bin)
-  --infodir=DIR           info documentation in DIR [PREFIX/info]
-  --mandir=DIR            man documentation in DIR [PREFIX/man]
-
-For example, if you are not root and want to install Wget in
-subdirectories of your home directory, you can use:
-
-    ./configure --prefix=$HOME
-
-In addition to the above generic options, Wget's configuration
-supports a number of options more or less specific to Wget.  Options
-beginning with "--disable", such as `--disable-opie' or
-`--disable-ntlm', allow you to turn off certain built-in functionality
-you don't need in order to reduce the size of the executable.  Options
-beginning with "--with" turning off autodetection and use of external
-software Wget can link with, such as the SSL libraries.  Recognized
-"--enable" and "--with" options include:
-
-  --without-ssl           disable SSL autodetection (used for https support)
-  --with-libssl-prefix=DIR search for libssl in DIR/lib
-  --disable-opie          disable support for opie or s/key FTP login
-  --disable-digest        disable support for HTTP digest authorization
-  --disable-ntlm          disable support for HTTP NTLM authorization
-  --disable-debug         disable support for debugging output
-  --disable-nls           do not use Native Language Support
-  --disable-largefile     omit support for large files
-  --disable-ipv6          disable IPv6 support
-  --disable-rpath         do not hardcode runtime library paths
-  --disable-iri           disable IDN/IRIs support
-
-For the full list, see the output of `./configure --help'.
-
-You can inspect decisions made by configure by editing the generated
-Makefiles and the `src/config.h' include file.  The defaults should
-work without intervention, but if you know what you are doing, editing
-the generated files before compilation is fine -- they will not be
-regenerated until you run configure again.
-
-`configure' will try to find a compiler in your PATH, defaulting to
-`gcc', but falling back to `cc' if the former is unavailable.  This is
-a reasonable default on most Unix-like systems, but sometimes you
-might want to override it.  The compiler choice is overridden by
-setting the `CC' environment variable to the desired compiler file
-name.  For example, to force compilation with the Unix `cc' compiler,
-invoke configure like this:
-
-    ./configure CC=cc
-
-This assumes that `cc' is in your path -- if it is not, simply use
-CC=/path/to/cc instead.  Note that environment variables that affect
-configure can be set with the usual shell syntax `VAR=value ./configure'
-(assuming sh syntax), but can also be specified as arguments to
-configure, as shown above.  The latter method, while being specific to
-configure, works unmodified in all shells, and in addition allows
-configure to detect when that setting has been changed across
-invocations.
-
-Environment variables that affect `configure' include: CFLAGS for C
-compiler flags, CPPFLAGS for C preprocessor flags, LDFLAGS for linker
-flags, and LIBS for libraries.
-
-Barring the use of --without-* flags, configure will try to autodetect
-external libraries needed by Wget, currently only the OpenSSL
-libraries.  If they are installed in the system library directories or
-in the same prefix where you plan to install Wget, configure should be
-able to autodetect them.  If they are installed elsewhere, use the
-`--with-libNAME' option to specify the root directory under which
-libraries reside in the `lib/' subdirectory and the corresponding
-header files reside in the `include/' subdirectory.  For example, if
-the OpenSSL libraries are installed under the /usr/local/ssl prefix,
-use `--with-libssl=/usr/local/ssl'.
-
-Sometimes external libraries will be installed on the system, but the
-header files will be missing.  This often happens on GNU/Linux if you
-forget to install the "-devel" or "-dev" package that corresponds to
-the library and that is typically *not* installed by default.  In that
-case configure will not find the library and you will not be able to
-use the features provided by the library until you install the devel
-package and rerun configure.  If you believe you have the necessary
-headers, but configure still fails to detect the library, please
-report it as a bug.
-
-3. Compilation
---------------
-
-To compile GNU Wget after it has been configured, simply type make.
-Wget requires a compiler and standard library compliant with the 1990
-ISO C standard, which includes the vast majority of compilation
-environments present on systems in use today.
-
-After the compilation a ready-to-use `wget' executable should reside
-in the src directory.  At this point there is no formal test suite for
-testing the binary, but it should be easy enough to test whether the
-basic functionality works.
-
-4. Installation
----------------
-
-Use `make install' to install GNU Wget to directories specified to
-configure.  To install it in a system directory (which is the
-default), you will need to be root.  The standard prefix is
-"/usr/local/", which can be changed using the `--prefix' configure
-option.
-
-The installation process will copy the wget binary to $PREFIX/bin,
-install the wget.info* info pages to $PREFIX/info, the generated
-manual page (where available) wget.1 to $PREFIX/man/man1, and the
-default config file to $PREFIX/etc, unless a config file already
-exists there.  You can customize these directories either through the
-configuration process or making the necessary changes in the Makefile.
-
-To delete the files created by Wget installation, you can use `make
-uninstall'.

+Usage: $0 [OPTION]...
+Bootstrap this package from the checked-out sources.
+
+Options:
+ --gnulib-srcdir=DIRNAME  Specify the local directory where gnulib
+                          sources reside.  Use this if you already
+                          have gnulib sources on your machine, and
+                          do not want to waste your bandwidth downloading
+                          them again.  Defaults to \$GNULIB_SRCDIR.
+ --copy                   Copy files instead of creating symbolic links.
+ --force                  Attempt to bootstrap even if the sources seem
+                          not to have been checked out.
+ --skip-po                Do not download po files.
+
+If the file $0.conf exists in the same directory as this script, its
+contents are read as shell variables to configure the bootstrap.
+
+For build prerequisites, environment variables like \$AUTOCONF and \$AMTAR
+are honored.
+
+Running without arguments will suffice in most cases.

-usage="Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]... [COMMAND] FILES... [[COMMAND] FILES...]
-
-Sign all FILES, and upload them to selected destinations, according to
-<http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Automated-FTP-Uploads.html>.
-
-Commands:
-  --delete                 delete FILES from destination
-  --symlink                create symbolic links
-  --rmsymlink              remove symbolic links
-  --                       treat the remaining arguments as files to upload
-
-Options:
-  --help                   print this help text and exit
-  --to DEST                specify one destination for FILES
-                           (multiple --to options are allowed)
-  --user NAME              sign with key NAME
-  --symlink-regex[=EXPR]   use sed script EXPR to compute symbolic link names
-  --dry-run                do nothing, show what would have been done
-  --version                output version information and exit
-
-If --symlink-regex is given without EXPR, then the link target name
-is created by replacing the version information with \`-latest', e.g.:
-
-  foo-1.3.4.tar.gz -> foo-latest.tar.gz
-
-Recognized destinations are:
-  alpha.gnu.org:DIRECTORY
-  savannah.gnu.org:DIRECTORY
-  savannah.nongnu.org:DIRECTORY
-  ftp.gnu.org:DIRECTORY
-                           build directive files and upload files by FTP
-  download.gnu.org.ua:{alpha|ftp}/DIRECTORY
-                           build directive files and upload files by SFTP
-  [user@]host:DIRECTORY    upload files with scp
-
-Options and commands are applied in order.  If the file $conffile exists
-in the current working directory, its contents are prepended to the
-actual command line options.  Use this to keep your defaults.  Comments
-(#) and empty lines in $conffile are allowed.
-
-Examples:
-1. Upload automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz and automake-1.8.2b.tar.bz2 to two sites:
-  gnupload --to sources.redhat.com:~ftp/pub/automake \\
-           --to alpha.gnu.org:automake \\
-           automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz automake-1.8.2b.tar.bz2
-
-2. Same as above, but also create symbolic links to automake-latest.tar.*:
-  gnupload --to sources.redhat.com:~ftp/pub/automake \\
-           --to alpha.gnu.org:automake \\
-           --symlink-regex \\
-           automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz automake-1.8.2b.tar.bz2
-
-3. Symlink automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz to automake-latest.tar.gz and
-automake-1.8.2b.tar.bz2 to automake-latest.tar.bz2 on both sites:
-
-  gnupload --to sources.redhat.com:~ftp/pub/automake \\
-           --to alpha.gnu.org:automake \\
-           --symlink automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz automake-latest.tar.gz \\
-                     automake-1.8.2b.tar.bz2 automake-latest.tar.bz2
-
-4. Delete automake-1.8.2a.tar.gz and .bz2, remove symlink
-automake-latest.tar.gz and upload automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz:
-
-  gnupload --to sources.redhat.com:~ftp/pub/automake \\
-           --to alpha.gnu.org:automake \\
-           --delete automake-1.8.2a.tar.gz automake-1.8.2a.tar.bz2 \\
-           --rmsymlink automake-latest.tar.gz \\
-           -- \\
-           automake-1.8.2b.tar.gz automake-1.8.2b.tar.bz2

-% To process a Texinfo manual with TeX, it's most reliable to use the
-% texi2dvi shell script that comes with the distribution.  For a simple
-% manual foo.texi, however, you can get away with this:
-%   tex foo.texi
-%   texindex foo.??
-%   tex foo.texi
-%   tex foo.texi
-%   dvips foo.dvi -o  # or whatever; this makes foo.ps.
-% The extra TeX runs get the cross-reference information correct.
-% Sometimes one run after texindex suffices, and sometimes you need more
-% than two; texi2dvi does it as many times as necessary.
-%
-% It is possible to adapt texinfo.tex for other languages, to some

-% @multitable macros
-% Amy Hendrickson, 8/18/94, 3/6/96
-%
-% @multitable ... @end multitable will make as many columns as desired.
-% Contents of each column will wrap at width given in preamble.  Width
-% can be specified either with sample text given in a template line,
-% or in percent of \hsize, the current width of text on page.
-
-% Table can continue over pages but will only break between lines.
-
-% To make preamble:
-%
-% Either define widths of columns in terms of percent of \hsize:
-%   @multitable @columnfractions .25 .3 .45
-%   @item ...
-%
-%   Numbers following @columnfractions are the percent of the total
-%   current hsize to be used for each column. You may use as many
-%   columns as desired.
-
-
-% Or use a template:
-%   @multitable {Column 1 template} {Column 2 template} {Column 3 template}
-%   @item ...
-%   using the widest term desired in each column.
-
-% Each new table line starts with @item, each subsequent new column
-% starts with @tab. Empty columns may be produced by supplying @tab's
-% with nothing between them for as many times as empty columns are needed,
-% ie, @tab@tab@tab will produce two empty columns.
-
-% @item, @tab do not need to be on their own lines, but it will not hurt
-% if they are.
-
-% Sample multitable:
-
-%   @multitable {Column 1 template} {Column 2 template} {Column 3 template}
-%   @item first col stuff @tab second col stuff @tab third col
-%   @item
-%   first col stuff
-%   @tab
-%   second col stuff
-%   @tab
-%   third col
-%   @item first col stuff @tab second col stuff
-%   @tab Many paragraphs of text may be used in any column.
-%
-%         They will wrap at the width determined by the template.
-%   @item@tab@tab This will be in third column.
-%   @end multitable
-
-% Default dimensions may be reset by user.
-% @multitableparskip is vertical space between paragraphs in table.
-% @multitableparindent is paragraph indent in table.
-% @multitablecolmargin is horizontal space to be left between columns.
-% @multitablelinespace is space to leave between table items, baseline
-%                                                            to baseline.

-
-# The arguments to this script should be names of files that contain FSF
-# copyright statements to be updated.  For example, you might wish to
-# use the update-copyright target rule in maint.mk from gnulib's
-# maintainer-makefile module.
-#
-# Iff an FSF copyright statement is recognized in a file and the final
-# year is not the current year, then the statement is updated for the
-# new year and it is reformatted to:
-#
-#   1. Fit within 72 columns.
-#   2. Convert 2-digit years to 4-digit years by prepending "19".
-#   3. Expand copyright year intervals.  (See "Environment variables"
-#      below.)
-#
-# A warning is printed for every file for which no FSF copyright
-# statement is recognized.
-#
-# Each file's FSF copyright statement must be formated correctly in
-# order to be recognized.  For example, each of these is fine:
-#
-#   Copyright @copyright{} 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Free Software
-#   Foundation, Inc.
-#
-#   # Copyright (C) 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Free Software
-#   # Foundation, Inc.
-#
-#   /*
-#    * Copyright &copy; 90,2005,2007-2009
-#    * Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-#    */
-#
-# However, the following format is not recognized because the line
-# prefix changes after the first line:
-#
-#   ## Copyright (C) 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Free Software
-#   #  Foundation, Inc.
-#
-# The following copyright statement is not recognized because the
-# copyright holder is not the FSF:
-#
-#   Copyright (C) 1990-2005, 2007-2009 Acme, Inc.
-#
-# However, any correctly formatted FSF copyright statement following
-# either of the previous two copyright statements would be recognized.
-#
-# The exact conditions that a file's FSF copyright statement must meet
-# to be recognized are:
-#
-#   1. It is the first FSF copyright statement that meets all of the
-#      following conditions.  Subsequent FSF copyright statements are
-#      ignored.
-#   2. Its format is "Copyright (C)", then a list of copyright years,
-#      and then the name of the copyright holder, which is "Free
-#      Software Foundation, Inc.".
-#   3. The "(C)" takes one of the following forms or is omitted
-#      entirely:
-#
-#        A. (C)
-#        B. (c)
-#        C. @copyright{}
-#        D. &copy;
-#
-#   4. The "Copyright" appears at the beginning of a line except that it
-#      may be prefixed by any sequence (e.g., a comment) of no more than
-#      5 characters.
-#   5. Iff such a prefix is present, the same prefix appears at the
-#      beginning of each remaining line within the FSF copyright
-#      statement.  There is one exception in order to support C-style
-#      comments: if the first line's prefix contains nothing but
-#      whitespace surrounding a "/*", then the prefix for all subsequent
-#      lines is the same as the first line's prefix except with each of
-#      "/" and possibly "*" replaced by a " ".  The replacement of "*"
-#      by " " is consistent throughout all subsequent lines.
-#   6. Blank lines, even if preceded by the prefix, do not appear
-#      within the FSF copyright statement.
-#   7. Each copyright year is 2 or 4 digits, and years are separated by
-#      commas or dashes.  Whitespace may appear after commas.
-#
-# Environment variables:
-#
-#   1. If UPDATE_COPYRIGHT_FORCE=1, a recognized FSF copyright statement
-#      is reformatted even if it does not need updating for the new
-#      year.  If unset or set to 0, only updated FSF copyright
-#      statements are reformatted.
-#   2. If UPDATE_COPYRIGHT_USE_INTERVALS=1, every series of consecutive
-#      copyright years (such as 90, 1991, 1992-2007, 2008) in a
-#      reformatted FSF copyright statement is collapsed to a single
-#      interval (such as 1990-2008).  If unset or set to 0, all existing
-#      copyright year intervals in a reformatted FSF copyright statement
-#      are expanded instead.
-#   3. For testing purposes, you can set the assumed current year in
-#      UPDATE_COPYRIGHT_YEAR.

-/* alloca.c -- allocate automatically reclaimed memory
-   (Mostly) portable public-domain implementation -- D A Gwyn
-
-   This implementation of the PWB library alloca function,
-   which is used to allocate space off the run-time stack so
-   that it is automatically reclaimed upon procedure exit,
-   was inspired by discussions with J. Q. Johnson of Cornell.
-   J.Otto Tennant <jot@cray.com> contributed the Cray support.
-
-   There are some preprocessor constants that can
-   be defined when compiling for your specific system, for
-   improved efficiency; however, the defaults should be okay.
-
-   The general concept of this implementation is to keep
-   track of all alloca-allocated blocks, and reclaim any
-   that are found to be deeper in the stack than the current
-   invocation.  This heuristic does not reclaim storage as
-   soon as it becomes invalid, but it will do so eventually.
-
-   As a special case, alloca(0) reclaims storage without
-   allocating any.  It is a good idea to use alloca(0) in
-   your main control loop, etc. to force garbage collection.  */

-	# - It returns the empty string when LANG is set to a locale of the
-	#   form ll_CC, although ll_CC/LC_CTYPE is a symlink to an UTF-8
-	#   LC_CTYPE file.
-	# - The environment variables LANG, LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL are not set by
-	#   the system; nl_langinfo(CODESET) returns "US-ASCII" in this case.
-	# - The documentation says:
-	#     "... all code that calls BSD system routines should ensure
-	#      that the const *char parameters of these routines are in UTF-8
-	#      encoding. All BSD system functions expect their string
-	#      parameters to be in UTF-8 encoding and nothing else."
-	#   It also says
-	#     "An additional caveat is that string parameters for files,
-	#      paths, and other file-system entities must be in canonical
-	#      UTF-8. In a canonical UTF-8 Unicode string, all decomposable
-	#      characters are decomposed ..."
-	#   but this is not true: You can pass non-decomposed UTF-8 strings
-	#   to file system functions, and it is the OS which will convert
-	#   them to decomposed UTF-8 before accessing the file system.
-	# - The Apple Terminal application displays UTF-8 by default.
-	# - However, other applications are free to use different encodings:
-	#   - xterm uses ISO-8859-1 by default.
-	#   - TextEdit uses MacRoman by default.
-	# We prefer UTF-8 over decomposed UTF-8-MAC because one should
-	# minimize the use of decomposed Unicode. Unfortunately, through the
-	# Darwin file system, decomposed UTF-8 strings are leaked into user
-	# space nevertheless.
-	# Then there are also the locales with encodings other than US-ASCII
-	# and UTF-8. These locales can be occasionally useful to users (e.g.
-	# when grepping through ISO-8859-1 encoded text files), when all their

-/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
-   given in OPTSTRING.
-
-   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
-   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
-   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
-   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
-   from each of the option elements.
-
-   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
-   updating `optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
-   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.
-
-   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns -1.
-   Then `optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
-   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
-   so that those that are not options now come last.)
-
-   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
-   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
-   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `opterr' to
-   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.
-
-   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
-   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
-   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
-   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
-   it is returned in `optarg', otherwise `optarg' is set to zero.
-
-   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
-   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
-   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.
-
-   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
-   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
-   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
-   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
-   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
-   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
-   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
-   if the `flag' field is zero.
-
-   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct option' terminated by an
-   element containing a name which is zero.
-
-   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
-   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
-   recent call.
-
-   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
-   long-named options.
-
-   If POSIXLY_CORRECT is nonzero, behave as if the POSIXLY_CORRECT

-     with repeated_c.  This reduces the task to testing whether *any of the
-     four* bytes in longword1 is zero.
-
-     We compute tmp =
-       ((longword1 - repeated_one) & ~longword1) & (repeated_one << 7).
-     That is, we perform the following operations:
-       1. Subtract repeated_one.
-       2. & ~longword1.
-       3. & a mask consisting of 0x80 in every byte.
-     Consider what happens in each byte:
-       - If a byte of longword1 is zero, step 1 and 2 transform it into 0xff,
-         and step 3 transforms it into 0x80.  A carry can also be propagated
-         to more significant bytes.
-       - If a byte of longword1 is nonzero, let its lowest 1 bit be at
-         position k (0 <= k <= 7); so the lowest k bits are 0.  After step 1,
-         the byte ends in a single bit of value 0 and k bits of value 1.
-         After step 2, the result is just k bits of value 1: 2^k - 1.  After
-         step 3, the result is 0.  And no carry is produced.
-     So, if longword1 has only non-zero bytes, tmp is zero.
-     Whereas if longword1 has a zero byte, call j the position of the least
-     significant zero byte.  Then the result has a zero at positions 0, ...,
-     j-1 and a 0x80 at position j.  We cannot predict the result at the more
-     significant bytes (positions j+1..3), but it does not matter since we
-     already have a non-zero bit at position 8*j+7.
-
-     So, the test whether any byte in longword1 is zero is equivalent to
-     testing whether tmp is nonzero.  */

-
-   Programs that use <stdbool.h> should be aware of some limitations

-
-   Standards compliance:
-
-       - <stdbool.h> must be #included before 'bool', 'false', 'true'
-         can be used.
-
-       - You cannot assume that sizeof (bool) == 1.
-
-       - Programs should not undefine the macros bool, true, and false,
-         as C99 lists that as an "obsolescent feature".
-
-   Limitations of this substitute, when used in a C89 environment:
-
-       - <stdbool.h> must be #included before the '_Bool' type can be used.
-
-       - You cannot assume that _Bool is a typedef; it might be a macro.
-
-       - Bit-fields of type 'bool' are not supported.  Portable code
-         should use 'unsigned int foo : 1;' rather than 'bool foo : 1;'.
-
-       - In C99, casts and automatic conversions to '_Bool' or 'bool' are
-         performed in such a way that every nonzero value gets converted
-         to 'true', and zero gets converted to 'false'.  This doesn't work
-         with this substitute.  With this substitute, only the values 0 and 1
-         give the expected result when converted to _Bool' or 'bool'.
-
-   Also, it is suggested that programs use 'bool' rather than '_Bool';

-     AVAILABLE(h, h_l, j, n_l)
-			     A macro that returns nonzero if there are

-			     H is 'unsigned char *', H_L, J, and N_L
-			     are 'size_t'; H_L is an lvalue.  For

-     CMP_FUNC(p1, p2, l)     A macro that returns 0 iff the first L
-			     characters of P1 and P2 are equal.
-     CANON_ELEMENT(c)        A macro that canonicalizes an element right after

-   The global period of a string is the smallest index (possibly its
-   length) at which all remaining bytes in the string are repetitions
-   of the prefix (the last repetition may be a subset of the prefix).
-
-   When NEEDLE is factored into two halves, a local period is the

-   and shares a prefix with the right half.  All factorizations of a
-   non-empty NEEDLE have a local period of at least 1 and no greater
-   than NEEDLE_LEN.
-
-   A critical factorization has the property that the local period
-   equals the global period.  All strings have at least one critical
-   factorization with the left half smaller than the global period.
-
-   Given an ordered alphabet, a critical factorization can be computed
-   in linear time, with 2 * NEEDLE_LEN comparisons, by computing the
-   larger of two ordered maximal suffixes.  The ordered maximal

-
-#ifndef VERIFY_H
-# define VERIFY_H 1
-
-/* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
-   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
-   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.
-
-   There are two macros, since no single macro can be used in all
-   contexts in C.  verify_true (R) is for scalar contexts, including
-   integer constant expression contexts.  verify (R) is for declaration
-   contexts, e.g., the top level.
-
-   Symbols ending in "__" are private to this header.
-
-   The code below uses several ideas.
-
-   * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
-     integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
-     expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
-     constant and nonnegative.
-
-   * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
-     struct verify_type__ { unsigned int verify_error_if_negative_size__: W; }.
-     If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
-     deal with a bit-field of negative size.
-
-     One might think that an array size check would have the same
-     effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
-     would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
-     (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
-     variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
-     an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
-     the verify macro:
-
-       void function (int n) { verify (n < 0); }
-
-   * For the verify macro, the struct verify_type__ will need to
-     somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
-     declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
-     typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
-     such as in
-
-       struct dummy {...};
-       typedef struct {...} dummy;
-       extern struct {...} *dummy;
-       extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
-       extern struct {...} *dummy (void);
-
-     two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
-     if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
-     attach the current line number to the entity name:
-
-       #define GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
-       #define GL_CONCAT(x, y) GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
-       extern struct {...} * GL_CONCAT(dummy,__LINE__);
-
-     But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
-     within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
-     would be the same for both invocations.
-
-     A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
-     getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like
-
-       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
-       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
-       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
-
-     can be repeated.
-
-   * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
-     Which of the following alternatives can be used?
-
-       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
-       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct verify_type__ {...})];
-       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
-       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct verify_type__ {...})]);
-       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
-       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct verify_type__ {...})];
-
-     In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
-     outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
-     about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
-     possibility is the fifth case:
-
-       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
-
-   * This implementation exploits the fact that GCC does not warn about
-     the last declaration mentioned above.  If a future version of GCC
-     introduces a warning for this, the problem could be worked around
-     by using code specialized to GCC, e.g.,:
-
-       #if 4 <= __GNUC__
-       # define verify(R) \
-	   extern int (* verify_function__ (void)) \
-		      [__builtin_constant_p (R) && (R) ? 1 : -1]
-       #endif
-
-   * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
-     Use a template type to work around the problem.  */

-   Return 1.  */

-
-   Repeated reallocations are guaranteed to make progress, either by

-     size_t allocated = 0;
-

-
-   This causes x2nrealloc to allocate a block of some nonzero size the
-   first time it is called.
-
-   To have finer-grained control over the initial size, set *PN to a
-   nonzero value before calling this function with P == NULL.  For
-   example:
-
-     int *p = NULL;
-     size_t used = 0;
-     size_t allocated = 0;
-     size_t allocated1 = 1000;

-dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
-
-dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
-dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
-dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
-dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
-dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
-dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
-dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
-dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
-dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
-dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
-dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
-dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
-dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
-dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
-dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
-dnl
-dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
-dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
-dnl    and used.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
-dnl    Catalog format: none
-dnl    Catalog extension: none
-dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
-dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
-dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
-dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
-dnl maintainers.

-dnl From Paul Eggert and Derek Price.
-
-dnl Sets INCLUDE_NEXT and PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER.
-dnl
-dnl INCLUDE_NEXT expands to 'include_next' if the compiler supports it, or to
-dnl 'include' otherwise.
-dnl
-dnl INCLUDE_NEXT_AS_FIRST_DIRECTIVE expands to 'include_next' if the compiler
-dnl supports it in the special case that it is the first include directive in
-dnl the given file, or to 'include' otherwise.
-dnl
-dnl PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER can be used in files that contain #include_next,
-dnl so as to avoid GCC warnings when the gcc option -pedantic is used.
-dnl '#pragma GCC system_header' has the same effect as if the file was found
-dnl through the include search path specified with '-isystem' options (as
-dnl opposed to the search path specified with '-I' options). Namely, gcc

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
-#.
-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
-#. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Glyphs>
-#. and use glyphs suitable for your language.

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
-#.
-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
-#. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Glyphs>
-#. and use glyphs suitable for your language.

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
-#.
-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left

-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".

-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
-#.
-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
-#. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Glyphs>
-#. and use glyphs suitable for your language.

-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".

-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left

-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should

-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead

-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
-#.
-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left

-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
-#.
-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
-#. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Glyphs>
-#. and use glyphs suitable for your language.

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and

-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left

-#. TRANSLATORS:
-#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
-#.
-#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
-#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
-#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
-#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
-#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
-#.
-#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
-#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
-#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
-#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
-#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
-#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.

-#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
