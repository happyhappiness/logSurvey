+@section Creating Archives
+
+To create a new archive, use @samp{tar --create}.  You should generally
+use the @samp{--file} option to specify the name the tar archive will
+have.  Then specify the names of the files you wish to place in the
+archive.  For example, to place the files @file{foo}, @file{bar}, and
+@file{baz} into an archive named @file{my-archive}, use the following
+command:
+
+@example
+tar --create --file=my-archive foo bar baz
+@end example
+
+The order of the arguments is not important.  You could also say:
+
+@example
+tar foo --create --file=my-archive bar baz
+@end example
+
+This order is harder to understand however.  In this manual, we will
+list the arguments in a reasonable order to make the commands easier to
+understand, but you can type them in any order you wish.
+
+If you don't specify the @samp{--file} option, then @code{tar} will use
+a default.  Usually this default is some physical tape drive attached to
+your machine.  If there is no tape drive attached, or the default is not
+meaningful, then tar will print an error message.  This error message
+might look roughly like one of the following:
+
+@example
+tar: can't open /dev/rmt8 : No such device or address
+tar: can't open /dev/rsmt0 : I/O error
+@end example
+
+If you get an error like this, mentioning a file you didn't specify
+(@file{/dev/rmt8} or @file{/dev/rsmt0} in the examples above), then @code{tar}
+is using a default value for @samp{--file}.  You should generally specify a
+@samp{--file} argument whenever you use @code{tar}, rather than relying
+on a default.
+
+If you don't specify the names of any files to put in the archive, then
+tar will create an empty archive.  So, the following command will create
+an archive with nothing in it:
+
+@example
+tar --create --file=my-empty-archive
+@end example
+
+Whenever you use @samp{tar --create}, @code{tar} will erase the current
+contents of the file named by @samp{--file} if it exists.  To add files
+to an existing archive, you need to use a different option.
+@xref{Adding to Archives} for information on how to do this.
+
+The names of the members of an archive are called @dfn{member names}.
+When @samp{tar --create} creates an archive, the member names of the
+members of the archive are exactly the same as the file names as you
+typed them in the @code{tar} command.  So, the member names of
+@file{my-archive} (as created by the first example above) are
+@file{foo}, @file{bar}, and @file{baz}.  However, suppose the archive
+were created with this command instead:
+
+@example
+tar --create --file=my-new-archive ./foo bar ./baz
+@end example
+
+Then, the same three files would get placed in the archive (because
+@file{./} is a synonym for the current directory), but their member
+names would now be @file{./foo}, @file{bar}, and @file{./baz}.
+
+If you want to see the progress of tar as it writes files into the
+archive, you can use the @samp{--verbose} option.
+
+If one of the files named to @samp{tar --create} is a directory, then
+the operation of tar is more complicated.  @xref{Tar and Directories},
+the last section of this tutorial, for more information.
+
+@section Listing Archives
+
+Use @samp{tar --list} to print the names of members stored in an
+archive.  Use a @samp{--file} option just as with @samp{tar --create} to
+specify the name of the archive.  For example, the archive
+@file{my-archive} created in the last section could be examined with the
+command @samp{tar --list --file=my-archive}.  The output of tar would
+then be:
+
+@example
+foo
+bar
+baz
+@end example
+
+The archive @file{my-new-archive} would list as follows:
+
+@example
+./foo
+bar
+./baz
+@end example
+
+Note that, despite the identical contents of the two archives' members,
+the member names are different.  (Of course, @samp{tar --list
+--file=my-empty-archive} would produce no output.)
+
+If you use the @samp{--verbose} option with @samp{tar --list}, then tar
+will print out a listing reminiscent of @samp{ls -l}, showing owner,
+file size, and so forth.
+
+You can also specify member names when using @samp{tar --list}.  In this
+case, tar will only list the names of members you identify.  For
+example, @samp{tar --list --file=my-archive foo} would only print
+@samp{foo}.  It is essential when specifying member names to tar that
+you give the exact member names.  For example, @samp{tar --list
+--file=my-new-archive foo} would produce no output, because there is no
+member named @file{foo}, only one named @file{./foo}.  While the file
+names @file{foo} and @file{./foo} name the same file, member names are
+compared using a simplistic name comparison, in which an exact match is
+necessary.  
+
+@section Extracting Files from an Archive
+
+In order to extract files from an archive, use @samp{tar --extract}.
+Specify the name of the archive with @samp{--file}.  To extract specific
+archive members, give their member names as arguments.  It essential to
+give their exact member name, as printed by @samp{tar --list}.  
+
+Keeping the example of the two archives created at the beginning of this
+tutorial, @samp{tar --extract --file=my-archive foo} would create a file
+@file{foo} in the current directory with the contents of the archive
+member @file{foo}.  It would remove any file named @file{foo} already
+present in the directory, but it would not change the archive in any
+way.
+
+Remember that specifying the exact member name is important.  @samp{tar
+--extract --file=my-new-archive foo} will fail, because there is no
+member named @file{foo}.  To extract the member named @file{./foo} you
+would need to specify @samp{tar --extract --file=my-new-archive ./foo}.
+To find the exact member names of the members of an archive, use
+@samp{tar --list}.  @xref{Listing Archives}.
+
+If you do not list any archive member names, then @samp{tar --extract}
+will extract all the members of the archive.
+
+If you give the @samp{--verbose} option, then @samp{tar --extract} will
+print the names of the archive members as it extracts them.
+
+@section Adding Files to Existing Archives
+
+If you want to add files to an existing archive, then don't use
+@samp{tar --create}.  That will erase an archive and create a new one in
+its place.  Instead, use @samp{tar --add-file}.  The command @samp{tar
+--add-file --file=my-archive qux} would add the file @file{qux} to the
+existing archive @file{my-archive}.  It is essential that the archive
+exist already in order to use @samp{tar --add-file}.
+
+As with @samp{tar --create}, the member names of the newly added files
+will be the exact same as their names given on the command line.  The
+@samp{--verbose} option will print out the names of the files as they
+are written into the archive.
+
+If you add a file to an archive using @samp{tar --add-file} with the
+same name as an archive member already present in the archive, then the
+old member is not deleted.  What does happen, however, is somewhat
+complex.  @xref{Multiple Members with the Same Name}.  If you want to
+replace an archive member, use @samp{tar --delete} first, and then use
+@samp{tar --add-file}.
+
+@section Deleting Files from Archives
+
+You can delete files from an archive using @samp{tar --delete}.  Specify
+the name of the archive with @samp{--file}.  List the member names of
+the files to be deleted.  If you list no member names, then nothing will
+be deleted.  The @samp{--verbose} option will cause @code{tar} to print
+the names of the members as they are deleted.  As with @samp{tar
+--extract}, it is important that you give the exact member names when
+using @samp{tar --delete}.  Use @samp{tar --list} to find out the exact
+member names in an archive (@pxref{Listing Archives}).
+
+The @samp{tar --delete} command only works with archives stored on disk.
+Archives stored on a tape drive cannot be deleted from.
+
+@section Directories 
+
+When the names of files or member names specify directories, the
+operation of @code{tar} is more complex.  Generally, when a directory is
+named, @code{tar} also operates on all the contents of the directory,
+recursively.  Thus, to @code{tar}, the file name @file{/} names the
+entire file system.  
+
+To archive the entire contents of a directory, use @samp{tar --create}
+(or @samp{tar --add-file}) as usual, and specify the name of the
+directory.  For example, to archive all the contents of the current
+directory, use @samp{tar --create --file=@var{archive-name} .}.  Doing
+this will give the archive members names starting with @samp{./}.  To
+archive the contents of a directory named @file{foodir}, use @samp{tar
+--create --file=@var{archive-name} foodir}.  In this case, the member
+names will all start with @samp{foodir/}.
+
+If you give @code{tar} a command such as @samp{tar --create --file=foo
+.}, it will report @samp{tar: foo is the archive; not dumped}.  This
+happens because the archive @file{foo} is created before putting any
+files into it.  Then, when @code{tar} attempts to add all the files in
+the directory @file{.} to the archive, it notices that the file
+@file{foo} is the same as the archive, and skips it.  (It makes no sense
+to put an archive into itself.)  GNU @code{tar} will continue in this
+case, and create the archive as normal, except for the exclusion of that
+one file.  Other versions of @code{tar}, however, are not so clever, and
+will enter an infinite loop when this happens, so you should not depend
+on this behavior.  In general, make sure that the archive is not inside
+a directory being dumped.
+
+When extracting files, you can also name directory archive members on
+the command line.  In this case, @code{tar} extracts all the archive
+members whose names begin with the name of the directory.  As usual,
+@code{tar} is not particularly clever about interpreting member names.
+The command @samp{tar --extract --file=@var{archive-name} .} will not
+extract all the contents of the archive, but only those members whose
+member names begin with @samp{./}.

-
-This example shows you how to create an archive file in the working
-directory containing other files in the working directory.  The three
-files you archive in this example are called @file{blues},
-@file{folk}, and @file{jazz}.  The archive file is called
-@file{records}.  While the archive in this example is written to the
-file system, it could also be written to any other device.
-
-(If you want to follow along with this and future examples, create a
-directory called @file{practice} containing files called @file{blues},
-@file{folk} and @file{jazz}.  To create the directory, type
-@samp{mkdir practice} at the system prompt.  It will probably be
-easiest to create the files using a text editor, such as Emacs.)
-
-First, change into the directory containing the files you want to
-archive:
-
-@example
-% cd practice
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-@file{~/practice} is now your working directory.
-
-Then, check that the files to be archived do in fact exist in the
-working directory, and make sure there isn't already a file in the
-working directory with the archive name you intend to use.  If you
-specify an archive file name that is already in use, @code{tar} will
-overwrite the old file and its contents will be lost.
-
-To list the names of files in the working directory, type:

-To restore your files to their old positions, delete the new directory
-and its contents, and then redo the example above with your home
-directory as the working directory:
-
-@example
-% rm ~/practice/practice/*
-% rmdir practice

-@section Comparing Files in an Archive with Files in the File System
-
-To compare the attributes of archive members with the attributes of
-their counterparts in the file system, use the @samp{--compare},
-@samp{--diff}, or @samp{-d}) operation.  While you could use
-@samp{--list --verbose} to manually compare some file attributes, it is
-simpler to have @code{tar} itself compare file attributes and report
-back on file differences.
-@c <<<"manually"?  suggestions?  -ringo
-
-The @samp{--compare} operation, as its name implies, compares archive
-members with files of the same name in the file system, and reports
-back differences in file size, mode, owner and modification date.
-@samp{tar --compare} acts only on archive members---it ignores files in
-the file system that are not stored in the archive.  If you give
-@samp{tar --compare} a file-name argument that does not correspond to
-the name of an archive member, @code{tar} responds with an error
-message.
-
-To compare archive members in the archive file @file{records} with
-files in the @file{~/practice} directory, first change into the
-@file{practice} directory.  Then:
-
-@itemize @bullet
-@item
-Invoke @code{tar} and specify the @samp{--compare} operation.
-(@samp{--compare}, @samp{--diff}, or @samp{-d}).
-
-@item
-Specify the archive where the files to be compared are stored
-(@samp{--file=@var{archive-name}} or @samp{-f @var{archive-name}})
-
-@item
-Specify the archive members to be compared.  (In this example you are
-comparing all the archive members in the archive.  Since this is the
-default, you don't need to use any file-name arguments).
-@end itemize
-
-@example
-% tar --compare --file=records
-%
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-While it looks like nothing has happened, @code{tar} has, in fact,
-done the comparison---and found nothing to report.  
-
-Use the @samp{--verbose} option to list the names of archive members as
-they are being compared with their counterparts of the same name in
-the file system:
-
-@example
-% tar --compare --verbose --file=records
-blues
-folk
-jazz
-%
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-If @code{tar} had had anything to report, it would have done so as it
-was comparing each file.  
-
-If you remove the file @file{jazz} from the file system (@samp{rm
-jazz}), and modify the file @file{blues} (for instance, by adding text
-to it with an editor such as Emacs), the above example would look
-like:
-
-@example
-% tar --compare --verbose --file=records
-blues
-blues: mod time differs
-blues: size differs
-folk
-jazz
-jazz: does not exist
-% 
-@end example
-
-Note again that while @samp{tar --compare} reports the names of archive
-members that do not have counterparts in the file system, @samp{tar
---compare} ignores files in the file system that do not have
-counterparts in the archive.  To demonstrate this, create a file in
-the @file{practice} directory called @file{rock} (using any text
-editor).  The new file appears when you list the directory's contents:
-
-@example
-% ls
-blues	 folk	  records  rock
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-If you type the @samp{--compare} example again, @code{tar} prints the
-following:
-
-@example
-% tar --compare --verbose --file=records
-blues
-blues: mod time differs
-blues: size differs
-folk
-jazz
-jazz: does not exist
-% 
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-@code{tar} ignores the file @file{rock} because @code{tar} is
-comparing archive members to files in the file system, not vice versa.
-
-If you specify @file{rock} explicitly (using a file-name argument),
-@code{tar} prints an error message:
-
-@example
-% tar --compare --verbose --file=records rock
-tar: rock not found in archive

-@subsubsection Using Compare on Directories
-
-In addition to using @samp{--compare} to compare text files, you can
-use @samp{--compare} to compare directories.  To illustrate this,
-re-create the examples above using your home directory as the working
-directory, and using the archive file @file{~/music} instead of the
-archive file @file{~/practice/records}.
-
-First, change into your home directory (@samp{cd ~}).  Then, try the

-While you can use @code{tar} to create a new archive every time you
-want to store a file, it is more sometimes efficient to add files to
-an existing archive.  
-
-To add new files to an existing archive, use the @samp{--add-file},

-archive members to an archive, use the @samp{--update} or @samp{-u}

-@node Append, Update, Adding to Archives, Adding to Archives
-@subsection Appending Files to an Archive
-
-The simplest method of adding a file to an existing archive is the
-@samp{--add-file}, @samp{-r} or @samp{--append} operation, which writes
-files into the archive without regard to whether or not they are
-already archive members.  When you use @samp{--add-file} you must use
-file-name arguments; there is no default.  If you specify a file that
-is already stored in the archive, @code{tar} adds another copy of the
-file to the archive.
-
-If you have been following the previous examples, you should have a
-text file called @file{~/practice/rock} which has not been stored in
-either the archive file @file{~/practice/records}, or the archive file
-@file{~/music}.  To add @file{rock} to @file{records}, first make
-@file{practice} the working directory (@samp{cd practice}).  Then:
-
-@itemize @bullet
-@item
-Invoke @code{tar} and specify the @samp{--add-file} operation
-(@samp{--add-file}, @samp{-r} or @samp{--append})
-
-@item
-Specify the archive to which the file will be added
-(@samp{--file=@var{archive-name}} or @samp{-f @var{archive-name}})
-
-@item
-Specify the files to be added to the archive, using file-name
-arguments
-@end itemize
-
-@noindent
-For example:
-
-@example
-% tar --add-file --file=records rock
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-If you list the archive members in @file{records}, you will see that
-@file{rock} has been added to the archive:
-
-@example
-% tar --list --file=records
-blues
-folk
-jazz
-rock
-@end example
-
-@c <<<  this should be some kind of node.  
-
-You can use @samp{--add-file} to keep archive members current with
-active files.  Because @samp{--add-file} stores a file whether or not
-there is already an archive member with the same file name, you can
-use @samp{--add-file} to add newer versions of archive members to an
-archive.  When you extract the file, only the version stored last will
-wind up in the file system.  Because @samp{tar --extract} extracts
-files from an archive in sequence, and overwrites files with the same
-name in the file system, if a file name appears more than once in an
-archive the last version of the file will overwrite the previous
-versions which have just been extracted.  
-
-If you recall from the examples using @samp{--compare} above,
-@file{blues} was changed after the archive @file{records} was created.
-It is simple, however, to use @samp{--add-file} to add the new version
-of @file{blues} to @file{records}:
-
-@example
-% tar --add-file --verbose --file=records blues
-blues
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-If you now list the contents of the archive, you will obtain the following:
-
-@example
-% tar --list -f records
-blues
-folk
-jazz
-rock
-blues
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-The newest version of @file{blues} is at the end of the archive.  When
-the files in @file{records} are extracted, the newer version of
-@file{blues} (which has the same name as the older) will overwrite the
-version stored first.  When @samp{tar --extract} is finished, only the
-newer version of @file{blues} is in the file system.  <<<xref
-keep-old-files>>>
-
-@node Update,  , Append, Adding to Archives
-@subsection Updating Files in an Archive
-
-To keep archive members up to date with their counterparts of the same
-name in the file system, use the @samp{--update} or @samp{-u}
-operation.  @samp{tar --update} adds a specified file to an archive if
-no file of that name is already stored in the archive.  If there is
-already an archive member with the same name, @code{tar} checks the
-modification date of the archive member, and adds the file only if its
-modification date is later.  If a file is stored in the archive but no
-longer exists under the same name in the active file system,
-@code{tar} reports an error.
-
-You could use the @samp{--add-file} option to keep an archive current,
-but do so you would either have to use the @samp{--compare} and
-@samp{--list} options to determine what files needed to be re-archived
-(which could waste a lot of time), or you would have to be willing to
-add identical copies of already archived files to the archive (which
-could waste a lot of space).
-
-You must use file-name arguments with the @samp{--update}
-operation---if you don't specify any files, @code{tar} won't act on
-any files. 
-
-To see the @samp{--update} option at work, create a new file,
-@file{~/practice/classical}, and modify the file
-@file{~/practice/blues} (you can use a text editor, such as Emacs, to
-do both these things).  Then, with @file{practice} as your working
-directory, invoke @samp{tar --update} using the names of all the files
-in the practice directory as file-name arguments, and specifying the
-@samp{--verbose} option:
-
-@example
-% tar --update --verbose --file=records blues folk rock classical
-blues
-classical
-%
-@end example
-
-@noindent
-Because you specified verbose mode, @code{tar} printed out the names
-of the files it acted on.  If you now list the archive members of the
-archive, (@samp{tar --list --file=records}), you will see that the file
-@file{classical} and another version of the file @file{blues} have
-been added to @file{records}.
-
-Note: When you update an archive, @code{tar} does not overwrite old
-archive members when it stores newer versions of a file.  This is
-because archive members appear in an archive in the order in which
-they are stored, and some archive devices do not allow writing in the
-middle of an archive.

-@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
-@section Concatenating Archives 
-
-To concatenate archive files, use @samp{tar --concatenate} or @samp{tar
--A}.  This operation adds other archives to the end of an archive.
-While it may seem intuitive to concatenate archives using @code{cat},
-the utility for adding files together, archive files which have been
-"catted" together cannot be read properly by @code{tar}.  Archive
-files incorporate an end of file marker---if archives are concatenated
-using @code{cat}, this marker will appear before the end of the new
-archive.  This will interfere with operations on that archive.
-@c <<<xref ignore-zeros>>>
-
-In earlier examples, you stored the @file{~/practice} directory in an
-archive file, @file{~/music}.  If you have been following the
-examples, you have since changed the contents of the @file{~/practice}
-directory.  There is a current version of the files in the
-@file{practice} directory, however, stored in the archive file
-@file{~/practice/records}.
-
-To store current versions of the files in @file{practice} in the
-archive file @file{music}, you can use @samp{tar --concatenate} to add
-the archive file @file{~/practice/records} to @file{music}.  First,
-make sure you are in your home directory (@samp{cd ~}).  Then:
-
-@itemize @bullet

-case, the file-name arguments are, unusually, the names of archive
-files.  (Remember to include the path in the archive name, if the
