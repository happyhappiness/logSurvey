+The patch produced by 'git format-patch' is in UNIX mailbox format,
+with a fixed "magic" time stamp to indicate that the file is output
+from format-patch rather than a real mailbox, like so:

+
+Typically it will be placed in a MUA's drafts folder, edited to add
+timely commentary that should not go in the changelog after the three
+dashes, and then sent as a message whose body, in our example, starts
+with "arch/arm config files were...".  On the receiving end, readers
+can save interesting patches in a UNIX mailbox and apply them with
+linkgit:git-am[1].
+
+When a patch is part of an ongoing discussion, the patch generated by
+'git format-patch' can be tweaked to take advantage of the 'git am
+--scissors' feature.  After your response to the discussion comes a
+line that consists solely of "`-- >8 --`" (scissors and perforation),
+followed by the patch with unnecessary header fields removed:
+
+------------
+...
+> So we should do such-and-such.
+
+Makes sense to me.  How about this patch?

+When sending a patch this way, most often you are sending your own
+patch, so in addition to the "`From $SHA1 $magic_timestamp`" marker you
+should omit `From:` and `Date:` lines from the patch file.  The patch
+title is likely to be different from the subject of the discussion the
+patch is in response to, so it is likely that you would want to keep
+the Subject: line, like the example above.
