-/* Thanks to Mike Haertel and Jim Avera for this test.
-   Here is a matrix of mmap possibilities:
-	mmap private not fixed
-	mmap private fixed at somewhere currently unmapped
-	mmap private fixed at somewhere already mapped
-	mmap shared not fixed
-	mmap shared fixed at somewhere currently unmapped
-	mmap shared fixed at somewhere already mapped
-   For private mappings, we should verify that changes cannot be read()
-   back from the file, nor mmap's back from the file at a different
-   address.  (There have been systems where private was not correctly
-   implemented like the infamous i386 svr4.0, and systems where the
-   VM page cache was not coherent with the filesystem buffer cache
-   like early versions of FreeBSD and possibly contemporary NetBSD.)
-   For shared mappings, we should conversely verify that changes get
-   propogated back to all the places they're supposed to be.
-
-   Grep wants private fixed already mapped.
-   The main things grep needs to know about mmap are:
-   * does it exist and is it safe to write into the mmap'd area
-   * how to use it (BSD variants)  */

-Overview
-********
-
-   GNU Wget is a freely available network utility to retrieve files from
-the World Wide Web, using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and FTP
-(File Transfer Protocol), the two most widely used Internet protocols.
-It has many useful features to make downloading easier, some of them
-being:
-
-   * Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
-     background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
-     start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
-     finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require
-     constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when
-     transferring a lot of data.
-
-
-   * Wget is capable of descending recursively through the structure of
-     HTML documents and FTP directory trees, making a local copy of the
-     directory hierarchy similar to the one on the remote server.  This
-     feature can be used to mirror archives and home pages, or traverse
-     the web in search of data, like a WWW robot (*note Robots::).  In
-     that spirit, Wget understands the `norobots' convention.
-
-
-   * File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories
-     are available when retrieving via FTP.  Wget can read the
-     time-stamp information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and
-     store it locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has
-     changed since last retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new
-     version if it has.  This makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP
-     sites, as well as home pages.
-
-
-   * Wget works exceedingly well on slow or unstable connections,
-     retrying the document until it is fully retrieved, or until a
-     user-specified retry count is surpassed.  It will try to resume the
-     download from the point of interruption, using `REST' with FTP and
-     `Range' with HTTP servers that support them.
-
-
-   * By default, Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the
-     network load, speed up retrieval and provide access behind
-     firewalls.  However, if you are behind a firewall that requires
-     that you use a socks style gateway, you can get the socks library
-     and build wget with support for socks.  Wget also supports the
-     passive FTP downloading as an option.
-
-
-   * Builtin features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to
-     follow (*note Following Links::).
-
-
-   * The retrieval is conveniently traced with printing dots, each dot
-     representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default).
-     These representations can be customized to your preferences.
-
-
-   * Most of the features are fully configurable, either through
-     command line options, or via the initialization file `.wgetrc'
-     (*note Startup File::).  Wget allows you to define "global"
-     startup files (`/usr/local/etc/wgetrc' by default) for site
-     settings.
-
-
-   * Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may
-     use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
-     GNU General Public License, as published by the Free Software
-     Foundation (*note Copying::).

-Invoking
-********
-
-   By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:
-
-     wget [OPTION]... [URL]...
-
-   Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command
-line.  URL is a "Uniform Resource Locator", as defined below.
-
-   However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
-Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
-command to `.wgetrc' (*note Startup File::), or specifying it on the
-command line.

-
-URL Format
-==========
-
-   "URL" is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform
-resource locator is a compact string representation for a resource
-available via the Internet.  Wget recognizes the URL syntax as per
-RFC1738.  This is the most widely used form (square brackets denote
-optional parts):
-
-     http://host[:port]/directory/file
-     ftp://host[:port]/directory/file
-
-   You can also encode your username and password within a URL:
-
-     ftp://user:password@host/path
-     http://user:password@host/path
-
-   Either USER or PASSWORD, or both, may be left out.  If you leave out
-either the HTTP username or password, no authentication will be sent.
-If you leave out the FTP username, `anonymous' will be used.  If you
-leave out the FTP password, your email address will be supplied as a
-default password.(1)
-
-   You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as `%xy', `xy' being the
-hexadecimal representation of the character's ASCII value.  Some common
-unsafe characters include `%' (quoted as `%25'), `:' (quoted as `%3A'),
-and `@' (quoted as `%40').  Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list
-of unsafe characters.
-
-   Wget also supports the `type' feature for FTP URLs.  By default, FTP
-documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type `i'), which means that
-they are downloaded unchanged.  Another useful mode is the `a'
-("ASCII") mode, which converts the line delimiters between the
-different operating systems, and is thus useful for text files.  Here
-is an example:
-
-     ftp://host/directory/file;type=a
-
-   Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported,
-because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their widespreaded use.
-
-   FTP-only syntax (supported by `NcFTP'):
-     host:/dir/file
-
-   HTTP-only syntax (introduced by `Netscape'):
-     host[:port]/dir/file
-
-   These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
-supported in the future.
-
-   If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or
-do not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
-with your favorite browser, like `Lynx' or `Netscape'.
-
-   ---------- Footnotes ----------
-
-   (1) If you have a `.netrc' file in your home directory, password
-will also be searched for there.

-
-Option Syntax
-=============
-
-   Since Wget uses GNU getopts to process its arguments, every option
-has a short form and a long form.  Long options are more convenient to
-remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option
-styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you
-may write:
-
-     wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log
-
-   The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument
-may be omitted.  Instead `-o log' you can write `-olog'.
-
-   You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
-like:
-
-     wget -drc URL
-
-   This is a complete equivalent of:
-
-     wget -d -r -c URL
-
-   Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
-terminate them with `--'.  So the following will try to download URL
-`-x', reporting failure to `log':
-
-     wget -o log -- -x
-
-   The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
-convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
-useful to clear the `.wgetrc' settings.  For instance, if your `.wgetrc'
-sets `exclude_directories' to `/cgi-bin', the following example will
-first reset it, and then set it to exclude `/~nobody' and `/~somebody'.
-You can also clear the lists in `.wgetrc' (*note Wgetrc Syntax::).
-
-     wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody

-
-Basic Startup Options
-=====================
-
-`-V'
-`--version'
-     Display the version of Wget.
-
-`-h'
-`--help'
-     Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.
-
-`-b'
-`--background'
-     Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
-     specified via the `-o', output is redirected to `wget-log'.
-
-`-e COMMAND'
-`--execute COMMAND'
-     Execute COMMAND as if it were a part of `.wgetrc' (*note Startup
-     File::).  A command thus invoked will be executed _after_ the
-     commands in `.wgetrc', thus taking precedence over them.
-
-
-File: wget.info,  Node: Logging and Input File Options,  Next: Download Options,  Prev: Basic Startup Options,  Up: Invoking
-
-Logging and Input File Options
-==============================
-
-`-o LOGFILE'
-`--output-file=LOGFILE'
-     Log all messages to LOGFILE.  The messages are normally reported
-     to standard error.
-
-`-a LOGFILE'
-`--append-output=LOGFILE'
-     Append to LOGFILE.  This is the same as `-o', only it appends to
-     LOGFILE instead of overwriting the old log file.  If LOGFILE does
-     not exist, a new file is created.
-
-`-d'
-`--debug'
-     Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
-     developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
-     administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
-     support, in which case `-d' will not work.  Please note that
-     compiling with debug support is always safe--Wget compiled with
-     the debug support will _not_ print any debug info unless requested
-     with `-d'.  *Note Reporting Bugs::, for more information on how to
-     use `-d' for sending bug reports.
-
-`-q'
-`--quiet'
-     Turn off Wget's output.
-
-`-v'
-`--verbose'
-     Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
-     output is verbose.
-
-`-nv'
-`--non-verbose'
-     Non-verbose output--turn off verbose without being completely quiet
-     (use `-q' for that), which means that error messages and basic
-     information still get printed.
-
-`-i FILE'
-`--input-file=FILE'
-     Read URLs from FILE, in which case no URLs need to be on the
-     command line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in
-     an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to
-     be retrieved.  The FILE need not be an HTML document (but no harm
-     if it is)--it is enough if the URLs are just listed sequentially.
-
-     However, if you specify `--force-html', the document will be
-     regarded as `html'.  In that case you may have problems with
-     relative links, which you can solve either by adding `<base
-     href="URL">' to the documents or by specifying `--base=URL' on the
-     command line.
-
-`-F'
-`--force-html'
-     When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
-     file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
-     HTML files on your local disk, by adding `<base href="URL">' to
-     HTML, or using the `--base' command-line option.
-
-`-B URL'
-`--base=URL'
-     When used in conjunction with `-F', prepends URL to relative links
-     in the file specified by `-i'.

-
-Download Options
-================
-
-`--bind-address=ADDRESS'
-     When making client TCP/IP connections, `bind()' to ADDRESS on the
-     local machine.  ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or IP
-     address.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound to
-     multiple IPs.
-
-`-t NUMBER'
-`--tries=NUMBER'
-     Set number of retries to NUMBER.  Specify 0 or `inf' for infinite
-     retrying.
-
-`-O FILE'
-`--output-document=FILE'
-     The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but
-     all will be concatenated together and written to FILE.  If FILE
-     already exists, it will be overwritten.  If the FILE is `-', the
-     documents will be written to standard output.  Including this
-     option automatically sets the number of tries to 1.
-
-`-nc'
-`--no-clobber'
-     If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
-     wget's behavior depends on a few options, including `-nc'.  In
-     certain cases, the local file will be "clobbered", or overwritten,
-     upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.
-
-     When running wget without `-N', `-nc', or `-r', downloading the
-     same file in the same directory will result in the original copy
-     of `FILE' being preserved and the second copy being named
-     `FILE.1'.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy
-     will be named `FILE.2', and so on.  When `-nc' is specified, this
-     behavior is suppressed, and wget will refuse to download newer
-     copies of `FILE'.  Therefore, "no-clobber" is actually a misnomer
-     in this mode - it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the
-     numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather
-     the multiple version saving that's prevented.
-
-     When running wget with `-r', but without `-N' or `-nc',
-     re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
-     overwriting the old.  Adding `-nc' will prevent this behavior,
-     instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer
-     copies on the server to be ignored.
-
-     When running wget with `-N', with or without `-r', the decision as
-     to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on
-     the local and remote timestamp and size of the file (*note
-     Time-Stamping::).  `-nc' may not be specified at the same time as
-     `-N'.
-
-     Note that when `-nc' is specified, files with the suffixes `.html'
-     or (yuck) `.htm' will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as
-     if they had been retrieved from the Web.
-
-`-c'
-`--continue'
-     Continue getting an existing file.  This is useful when you want to
-     finish up the download started by another program, or a previous
-     instance of Wget.  Thus you can write:
-
-          wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
-
-     If there is a file name `ls-lR.Z' in the current directory, Wget
-     will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
-     will require the server to continue the retrieval from an offset
-     equal to the length of the local file.
-
-     Note that you need not specify this option if all you want is Wget
-     to continue retrieving where it left off when the connection is
-     lost--Wget does this by default.  You need this option only when
-     you want to continue retrieval of a file already halfway
-     retrieved, saved by another FTP client, or left by Wget being
-     killed.
-
-     Without `-c', the previous example would just begin to download the
-     remote file to `ls-lR.Z.1'.  The `-c' option is also applicable
-     for HTTP servers that support the `Range' header.
-
-     Note that if you use `-c' on a file that's already downloaded
-     completely, `FILE' will not be changed, nor will a second `FILE.1'
-     copy be created.
-
-`--dot-style=STYLE'
-     Set the retrieval style to STYLE.  Wget traces the retrieval of
-     each document by printing dots on the screen, each dot
-     representing a fixed amount of retrieved data.  Any number of dots
-     may be separated in a "cluster", to make counting easier.  This
-     option allows you to choose one of the pre-defined styles,
-     determining the number of bytes represented by a dot, the number
-     of dots in a cluster, and the number of dots on the line.
-
-     With the `default' style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots
-     in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.  The `binary' style has a more
-     "computer"-like orientation--8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots
-     per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The `mega' style is
-     suitable for downloading very large files--each dot represents 64K
-     retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each
-     line (so each line contains 3M).  The `micro' style is exactly the
-     reverse; it is suitable for downloading small files, with 128-byte
-     dots, 8 dots per cluster, and 48 dots (6K) per line.
-
-`-N'
-`--timestamping'
-     Turn on time-stamping.  *Note Time-Stamping::, for details.
-
-`-S'
-`--server-response'
-     Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
-     servers.
-
-`--spider'
-     When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web "spider",
-     which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
-     they are there.  You can use it to check your bookmarks, e.g. with:
-
-          wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html
-
-     This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
-     functionality of real WWW spiders.
-
-`-T seconds'
-`--timeout=SECONDS'
-     Set the read timeout to SECONDS seconds.  Whenever a network read
-     is issued, the file descriptor is checked for a timeout, which
-     could otherwise leave a pending connection (uninterrupted read).
-     The default timeout is 900 seconds (fifteen minutes).  Setting
-     timeout to 0 will disable checking for timeouts.
-
-     Please do not lower the default timeout value with this option
-     unless you know what you are doing.
-
-`-w SECONDS'
-`--wait=SECONDS'
-     Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
-     of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
-     making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the
-     time can be specified in minutes using the `m' suffix, in hours
-     using `h' suffix, or in days using `d' suffix.
-
-     Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
-     or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
-     to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
-     retry.
-
-`--waitretry=SECONDS'
-     If you don't want Wget to wait between _every_ retrieval, but only
-     between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.
-     Wget will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first
-     failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second
-     failure on that file, up to the maximum number of SECONDS you
-     specify.  Therefore, a value of 10 will actually make Wget wait up
-     to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 seconds per file.
-
-     Note that this option is turned on by default in the global
-     `wgetrc' file.
-
-`-Y on/off'
-`--proxy=on/off'
-     Turn proxy support on or off. The proxy is on by default if the
-     appropriate environmental variable is defined.
-
-`-Q QUOTA'
-`--quota=QUOTA'
-     Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
-     specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with `k' suffix), or
-     megabytes (with `m' suffix).
-
-     Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So
-     if you specify `wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz',
-     all of the `ls-lR.gz' will be downloaded.  The same goes even when
-     several URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
-     respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input
-     file.  Thus you may safely type `wget -Q2m -i sites'--download
-     will be aborted when the quota is exceeded.
-
-     Setting quota to 0 or to `inf' unlimits the download quota.

-Directory Options
-=================
-
-`-nd'
-`--no-directories'
-     Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
-     recursively. With this option turned on, all files will get saved
-     to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
-     more than once, the filenames will get extensions `.n').
-
-`-x'
-`--force-directories'
-     The opposite of `-nd'--create a hierarchy of directories, even if
-     one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. `wget -x
-     http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt' will save the downloaded file to
-     `fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt'.
-
-`-nH'
-`--no-host-directories'
-     Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
-     invoking Wget with `-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/' will create a
-     structure of directories beginning with `fly.srk.fer.hr/'.  This
-     option disables such behavior.
-
-`--cut-dirs=NUMBER'
-     Ignore NUMBER directory components.  This is useful for getting a
-     fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
-     will be saved.
-
-     Take, for example, the directory at
-     `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/'.  If you retrieve it with `-r',
-     it will be saved locally under `ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/'.
-     While the `-nH' option can remove the `ftp.xemacs.org/' part, you
-     are still stuck with `pub/xemacs'.  This is where `--cut-dirs'
-     comes in handy; it makes Wget not "see" NUMBER remote directory
-     components.  Here are several examples of how `--cut-dirs' option
-     works.
-
-          No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
-          -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
-          -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
-          -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .
-          
-          --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
-          ...
-
-     If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
-     option is similar to a combination of `-nd' and `-P'.  However,
-     unlike `-nd', `--cut-dirs' does not lose with subdirectories--for
-     instance, with `-nH --cut-dirs=1', a `beta/' subdirectory will be
-     placed to `xemacs/beta', as one would expect.
-
-`-P PREFIX'
-`--directory-prefix=PREFIX'
-     Set directory prefix to PREFIX.  The "directory prefix" is the
-     directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
-     to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is `.' (the
-     current directory).

-HTTP Options
-============
-
-`-E'
-`--html-extension'
-     If a file of type `text/html' is downloaded and the URL does not
-     end with the regexp "\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?", this option will cause
-     the suffix `.html' to be appended to the local filename.  This is
-     useful, for instance, when you're mirroring a remote site that uses
-     `.asp' pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on
-     your stock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when you're
-     downloading the output of CGIs.  A URL like
-     `http://site.com/article.cgi?25' will be saved as
-     `article.cgi?25.html'.
-
-     Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded
-     every time you re-mirror a site, because wget can't tell that the
-     local `X.html' file corresponds to remote URL `X' (since it
-     doesn't yet know that the URL produces output of type `text/html'.
-     To prevent this re-downloading, you must use `-k' and `-K' so
-     that the original version of the file will be saved as `X.orig'
-     (*note Recursive Retrieval Options::).
-
-`--http-user=USER'
-`--http-passwd=PASSWORD'
-     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD on an HTTP server.
-     According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them
-     using either the `basic' (insecure) or the `digest' authentication
-     scheme.
-
-     Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
-     (*note URL Format::).  For more information about security issues
-     with Wget, *Note Security Considerations::.
-
-`-C on/off'
-`--cache=on/off'
-     When set to off, disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget
-     will send the remote server an appropriate directive (`Pragma:
-     no-cache') to get the file from the remote service, rather than
-     returning the cached version.  This is especially useful for
-     retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.
-
-     Caching is allowed by default.
-
-`--ignore-length'
-     Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
-     precise) send out bogus `Content-Length' headers, which makes Wget
-     go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can
-     spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again
-     and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal)
-     connection has closed on the very same byte.
-
-     With this option, Wget will ignore the `Content-Length' header--as
-     if it never existed.
-
-`--header=ADDITIONAL-HEADER'
-     Define an ADDITIONAL-HEADER to be passed to the HTTP servers.
-     Headers must contain a `:' preceded by one or more non-blank
-     characters, and must not contain newlines.
-
-     You may define more than one additional header by specifying
-     `--header' more than once.
-
-          wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
-               --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
-                 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
-
-     Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
-     previous user-defined headers.
-
-`--proxy-user=USER'
-`--proxy-passwd=PASSWORD'
-     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD for authentication
-     on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the `basic'
-     authentication scheme.
-
-`--referer=URL'
-     Include `Referer: URL' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
-     retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they
-     are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only
-     come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
-     point to them.
-
-`-s'
-`--save-headers'
-     Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
-     actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.
-
-`-U AGENT-STRING'
-`--user-agent=AGENT-STRING'
-     Identify as AGENT-STRING to the HTTP server.
-
-     The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
-     `User-Agent' header field.  This enables distinguishing the WWW
-     software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
-     protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as `Wget/VERSION',
-     VERSION being the current version number of Wget.
-
-     However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
-     tailoring the output according to the `User-Agent'-supplied
-     information.  While conceptually this is not such a bad idea, it
-     has been abused by servers denying information to clients other
-     than `Mozilla' or Microsoft `Internet Explorer'.  This option
-     allows you to change the `User-Agent' line issued by Wget.  Use of
-     this option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are
-     doing.

-FTP Options
-===========
-
-`--retr-symlinks'
-     Usually, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a symbolic
-     link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.
-     Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local
-     filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless
-     this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
-     downloaded it anyway.
-
-     When `--retr-symlinks' is specified, however, symbolic links are
-     traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time,
-     this option does not cause wget to traverse symlinks to
-     directories and recurse through them, but in the future it should
-     be enhanced to do this.
-
-     Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
-     specified on the commandline, rather than because it was recursed
-     to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always
-     traversed in this case.
-
-`-g on/off'
-`--glob=on/off'
-     Turn FTP globbing on or off.  Globbing means you may use the
-     shell-like special characters ("wildcards"), like `*', `?', `['
-     and `]' to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at
-     once, like:
-
-          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg
-
-     By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
-     globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on
-     or off permanently.
-
-     You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
-     your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
-     which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only
-     with Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix `ls' output).
-
-`--passive-ftp'
-     Use the "passive" FTP retrieval scheme, in which the client
-     initiates the data connection.  This is sometimes required for FTP
-     to work behind firewalls.

-
-Recursive Retrieval Options
-===========================
-
-`-r'
-`--recursive'
-     Turn on recursive retrieving.  *Note Recursive Retrieval::, for
-     more details.
-
-`-l DEPTH'
-`--level=DEPTH'
-     Specify recursion maximum depth level DEPTH (*note Recursive
-     Retrieval::).  The default maximum depth is 5.
-
-`--delete-after'
-     This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
-     _after_ having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
-     pages through a proxy, e.g.:
-
-          wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
-
-     The `-r' option is to retrieve recursively, and `-nd' to not
-     create directories.
-
-     Note that `--delete-after' deletes files on the local machine.  It
-     does not issue the `DELE' command to remote FTP sites, for
-     instance.  Also note that when `--delete-after' is specified,
-     `--convert-links' is ignored, so `.orig' files are simply not
-     created in the first place.
-
-`-k'
-`--convert-links'
-     Convert the non-relative links to relative ones locally.  Only the
-     references to the documents actually downloaded will be converted;
-     the rest will be left unchanged.
-
-     Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which
-     links have been downloaded.  Because of that, much of the work
-     done by `-k' will be performed at the end of the downloads.
-
-`-K'
-`--backup-converted'
-     When converting a file, back up the original version with a `.orig'
-     suffix.  Affects the behavior of `-N' (*note HTTP Time-Stamping
-     Internals::).
-
-`-m'
-`--mirror'
-     Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
-     recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
-     keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to `-r
-     -N -l inf -nr'.
-
-`-nr'
-`--dont-remove-listing'
-     Don't remove the temporary `.listing' files generated by FTP
-     retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
-     listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
-     useful to access the full remote file list when running a mirror,
-     or for debugging purposes.
-
-`-p'
-`--page-requisites'
-     This option causes wget to download all the files that are
-     necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes
-     such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
-
-     Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
-     documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
-     downloaded.  Using `-r' together with `-l' can help, but since
-     wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
-     documents, one is generally left with "leaf documents" that are
-     missing their requisites.
-
-     For instance, say document `1.html' contains an `<IMG>' tag
-     referencing `1.gif' and an `<A>' tag pointing to external document
-     `2.html'.  Say that `2.html' is the same but that its image is
-     `2.gif' and it links to `3.html'.  Say this continues up to some
-     arbitrarily high number.
-
-     If one executes the command:
-
-          wget -r -l 2 http://SITE/1.html
-
-     then `1.html', `1.gif', `2.html', `2.gif', and `3.html' will be
-     downloaded.  As you can see, `3.html' is without its requisite
-     `3.gif' because wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to
-     2) away from `1.html' in order to determine where to stop the
-     recursion.  However, with this command:
-
-          wget -r -l 2 -p http://SITE/1.html
-
-     all the above files _and_ `3.html''s requisite `3.gif' will be
-     downloaded.  Similarly,
-
-          wget -r -l 1 -p http://SITE/1.html
-
-     will cause `1.html', `1.gif', `2.html', and `2.gif' to be
-     downloaded.  One might think that:
-
-          wget -r -l 0 -p http://SITE/1.html
-
-     would download just `1.html' and `1.gif', but unfortunately this
-     is not the case, because `-l 0' is equivalent to `-l inf' - that
-     is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a
-     handful of them, all specified on the commandline or in a `-i' URL
-     input file) and its requisites, simply leave off `-p' and `-l':
-
-          wget -p http://SITE/1.html
-
-     Note that wget will behave as if `-r' had been specified, but only
-     that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links
-     from that page to external documents will not be followed.
-     Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites (even
-     if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot
-     displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options
-     in addition to `-p':
-
-          wget -E -H -k -K -nh -p http://SITE/DOCUMENT
-
-     To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that wget's idea of an
-     external document link is any URL specified in an `<A>' tag, an
-     `<AREA>' tag, or a `<LINK>' tag other than `<LINK
-     REL="stylesheet">'.

-
-Recursive Accept/Reject Options
-===============================
-
-`-A ACCLIST --accept ACCLIST'
-`-R REJLIST --reject REJLIST'
-     Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
-     accept or reject (*note Types of Files:: for more details).
-
-`-D DOMAIN-LIST'
-`--domains=DOMAIN-LIST'
-     Set domains to be accepted and DNS looked-up, where DOMAIN-LIST is
-     a comma-separated list.  Note that it does _not_ turn on `-H'.
-     This option speeds things up, even if only one host is spanned
-     (*note Domain Acceptance::).
-
-`--exclude-domains DOMAIN-LIST'
-     Exclude the domains given in a comma-separated DOMAIN-LIST from
-     DNS-lookup (*note Domain Acceptance::).
-
-`--follow-ftp'
-     Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option, Wget
-     will ignore all the FTP links.
-
-`--follow-tags=LIST'
-     Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it
-     considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
-     retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
-     considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
-     comma-separated LIST with this option.
-
-`-G LIST'
-`--ignore-tags=LIST'
-     This is the opposite of the `--follow-tags' option.  To skip
-     certain HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to
-     download, specify them in a comma-separated LIST.
-
-     In the past, the `-G' option was the best bet for downloading a
-     single page and its requisites, using a commandline like:
-
-          wget -Ga,area -H -k -K -nh -r http://SITE/DOCUMENT
-
-     However, the author of this option came across a page with tags
-     like `<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">' and came to the realization that
-     `-G' was not enough.  One can't just tell wget to ignore `<LINK>',
-     because then stylesheets will not be downloaded.  Now the best bet
-     for downloading a single page and its requisites is the dedicated
-     `--page-requisites' option.
-
-`-H'
-`--span-hosts'
-     Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving
-     (*note All Hosts::).
-
-`-L'
-`--relative'
-     Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home
-     page without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts
-     (*note Relative Links::).
-
-`-I LIST'
-`--include-directories=LIST'
-     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow
-     when downloading (*note Directory-Based Limits:: for more
-     details.)  Elements of LIST may contain wildcards.
-
-`-X LIST'
-`--exclude-directories=LIST'
-     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude
-     from download (*note Directory-Based Limits:: for more details.)
-     Elements of LIST may contain wildcards.
-
-`-nh'
-`--no-host-lookup'
-     Disable the time-consuming DNS lookup of almost all hosts (*note
-     Host Checking::).
-
-`-np'
-
-`--no-parent'
-     Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
-     recursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees that
-     only the files _below_ a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.
-     *Note Directory-Based Limits::, for more details.

-Recursive Retrieval
-*******************
-
-   GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single HTTP
-or FTP server), depth-first following links and directory structure.
-This is called "recursive" retrieving, or "recursion".
-
-   With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML from the given
-URL, documents, retrieving the files the HTML document was referring
-to, through markups like `href', or `src'.  If the freshly downloaded
-file is also of type `text/html', it will be parsed and followed
-further.
-
-   The maximum "depth" to which the retrieval may descend is specified
-with the `-l' option (the default maximum depth is five layers).  *Note
-Recursive Retrieval::.
-
-   When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all the
-data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up to
-the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
-locally.  FTP retrieval is also limited by the `depth' parameter.
-
-   By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
-the one found on the remote server.
-
-   Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
-important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for WWW
-presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
-connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.
-
-   You should be warned that invoking recursion may cause grave
-overloading on your system, because of the fast exchange of data
-through the network; all of this may hamper other users' work.  The
-same stands for the foreign server you are mirroring--the more requests
-it gets in a rows, the greater is its load.
-
-   Careless retrieving can also fill your file system uncontrollably,
-which can grind the machine to a halt.
-
-   The load can be minimized by lowering the maximum recursion level
-(`-l') and/or by lowering the number of retries (`-t').  You may also
-consider using the `-w' option to slow down your requests to the remote
-servers, as well as the numerous options to narrow the number of
-followed links (*note Following Links::).
-
-   Recursive retrieval is a good thing when used properly.  Please take

-***************
-
-   When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve loads of
-unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly what
-they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.
-
-   For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
-`fly.srk.fer.hr', you will not want to download all the home pages that
-happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.
-
-   Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
-links it will follow.
-
-* Menu:
-
-* Relative Links::         Follow relative links only.
-* Host Checking::          Follow links on the same host.
-* Domain Acceptance::      Check on a list of domains.
-* All Hosts::              No host restrictions.
-* Types of Files::         Getting only certain files.
-* Directory-Based Limits:: Getting only certain directories.
-* FTP Links::              Following FTP links.

-Relative Links
-==============
-
-   When only relative links are followed (option `-L'), recursive
-retrieving will never span hosts.  No time-expensive DNS-lookups will
-be performed, and the process will be very fast, with the minimum
-strain of the network.  This will suit your needs often, especially when
-mirroring the output of various `x2html' converters, since they
-generally output relative links.
-

-File: wget.info,  Node: Host Checking,  Next: Domain Acceptance,  Prev: Relative Links,  Up: Following Links
-
-Host Checking
-=============
-
-   The drawback of following the relative links solely is that humans
-often tend to mix them with absolute links to the very same host, and
-the very same page.  In this mode (which is the default mode for
-following links) all URLs that refer to the same host will be retrieved.
-
-   The problem with this option are the aliases of the hosts and
-domains.  Thus there is no way for Wget to know that `regoc.srce.hr' and
-`www.srce.hr' are the same host, or that `fly.srk.fer.hr' is the same
-as `fly.cc.fer.hr'.  Whenever an absolute link is encountered, the host
-is DNS-looked-up with `gethostbyname' to check whether we are maybe
-dealing with the same hosts.  Although the results of `gethostbyname'
-are cached, it is still a great slowdown, e.g. when dealing with large
-indices of home pages on different hosts (because each of the hosts
-must be DNS-resolved to see whether it just _might_ be an alias of the
-starting host).
-
-   To avoid the overhead you may use `-nh', which will turn off
-DNS-resolving and make Wget compare hosts literally.  This will make
-things run much faster, but also much less reliable (e.g. `www.srce.hr'
-and `regoc.srce.hr' will be flagged as different hosts).
-
-   Note that modern HTTP servers allow one IP address to host several
-"virtual servers", each having its own directory hierarchy.  Such
-"servers" are distinguished by their hostnames (all of which point to
-the same IP address); for this to work, a client must send a `Host'
-header, which is what Wget does.  However, in that case Wget _must not_
-try to divine a host's "real" address, nor try to use the same hostname
-for each access, i.e. `-nh' must be turned on.
-
-   In other words, the `-nh' option must be used to enable the
-retrieval from virtual servers distinguished by their hostnames.  As the
-number of such server setups grow, the behavior of `-nh' may become the
-default in the future.
-

-
-Domain Acceptance
-=================
-
-   With the `-D' option you may specify the domains that will be
-followed.  The hosts the domain of which is not in this list will not be
-DNS-resolved.  Thus you can specify `-Dmit.edu' just to make sure that
-*nothing outside of MIT gets looked up*.  This is very important and
-useful.  It also means that `-D' does _not_ imply `-H' (span all
-hosts), which must be specified explicitly.  Feel free to use this
-options since it will speed things up, with almost all the reliability
-of checking for all hosts.  Thus you could invoke
-
-     wget -r -D.hr http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
-
-   to make sure that only the hosts in `.hr' domain get DNS-looked-up
-for being equal to `fly.srk.fer.hr'.  So `fly.cc.fer.hr' will be
-checked (only once!) and found equal, but `www.gnu.ai.mit.edu' will not
-even be checked.
-
-   Of course, domain acceptance can be used to limit the retrieval to
-particular domains with spanning of hosts in them, but then you must
-specify `-H' explicitly.  E.g.:
-
-     wget -r -H -Dmit.edu,stanford.edu http://www.mit.edu/
-
-   will start with `http://www.mit.edu/', following links across MIT
-and Stanford.
-
-   If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do it
-with `--exclude-domains', which accepts the same type of arguments of
-`-D', but will _exclude_ all the listed domains.  For example, if you
-want to download all the hosts from `foo.edu' domain, with the
-exception of `sunsite.foo.edu', you can do it like this:
-
-     wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu http://www.foo.edu/

-
-All Hosts
-=========
-
-   When `-H' is specified without `-D', all hosts are freely spanned.
-There are no restrictions whatsoever as to what part of the net Wget
-will go to fetch documents, other than maximum retrieval depth.  If a
-page references `www.yahoo.com', so be it.  Such an option is rarely
-useful for itself.

-
-Types of Files
-==============
-
-   When downloading material from the web, you will often want to
-restrict the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you
-are interested in downloading GIFs, you will not be overjoyed to get
-loads of PostScript documents, and vice versa.
-
-   Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
-description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
-in `.wgetrc'.
-
-`-A ACCLIST'
-`--accept ACCLIST'
-`accept = ACCLIST'
-     The argument to `--accept' option is a list of file suffixes or
-     patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A
-     suffix is the ending part of a file, and consists of "normal"
-     letters, e.g. `gif' or `.jpg'.  A matching pattern contains
-     shell-like wildcards, e.g. `books*' or `zelazny*196[0-9]*'.
-
-     So, specifying `wget -A gif,jpg' will make Wget download only the
-     files ending with `gif' or `jpg', i.e. GIFs and JPEGs.  On the
-     other hand, `wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"' will download only files
-     beginning with `zelazny' and containing numbers from 1960 to 1969
-     anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for a
-     description of how pattern matching works.
-
-     Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined
-     into a comma-separated list, and given as an argument to `-A'.
-
-`-R REJLIST'
-`--reject REJLIST'
-`reject = REJLIST'
-     The `--reject' option works the same way as `--accept', only its
-     logic is the reverse; Wget will download all files _except_ the
-     ones matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.
-
-     So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
-     MPEGs and .AU files, you can use `wget -R mpg,mpeg,au'.
-     Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
-     `bjork', use `wget -R "bjork*"'.  The quotes are to prevent
-     expansion by the shell.
-
-   The `-A' and `-R' options may be combined to achieve even better
-fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g. `wget -A "*zelazny*" -R
-.ps' will download all the files having `zelazny' as a part of their
-name, but _not_ the PostScript files.
-
-   Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of HTML
-files; Wget must load all the HTMLs to know where to go at
-all--recursive retrieval would make no sense otherwise.

-Directory-Based Limits
-======================
-
-   Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
-place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
-those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for this--the
-home pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
-directories may contain useless information, e.g. `/cgi-bin' or `/dev'
-directories.
-
-   Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.
-Each option description lists a short name, a long name, and the
-equivalent command in `.wgetrc'.
-
-`-I LIST'
-`--include LIST'
-`include_directories = LIST'
-     `-I' option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
-     in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.
-     The directories are absolute paths.
-
-     So, if you wish to download from `http://host/people/bozo/'
-     following only links to bozo's colleagues in the `/people'
-     directory and the bogus scripts in `/cgi-bin', you can specify:
-
-          wget -I /people,/cgi-bin http://host/people/bozo/
-
-`-X LIST'
-`--exclude LIST'
-`exclude_directories = LIST'
-     `-X' option is exactly the reverse of `-I'--this is a list of
-     directories _excluded_ from the download.  E.g. if you do not want
-     Wget to download things from `/cgi-bin' directory, specify `-X
-     /cgi-bin' on the command line.
-
-     The same as with `-A'/`-R', these two options can be combined to
-     get a better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g. if
-     you want to load all the files from `/pub' hierarchy except for
-     `/pub/worthless', specify `-I/pub -X/pub/worthless'.
-
-`-np'
-`--no-parent'
-`no_parent = on'
-     The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
-     disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
-     "above" than the beginning directory, i.e. disallowing ascent to
-     the parent directory/directories.
-
-     The `--no-parent' option (short `-np') is useful in this case.
-     Using it guarantees that you will never leave the existing
-     hierarchy.  Supposing you issue Wget with:
-
-          wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/
-
-     You may rest assured that none of the references to
-     `/~his-girls-homepage/' or `/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/' will be
-     followed.  Only the archive you are interested in will be
-     downloaded.  Essentially, `--no-parent' is similar to
-     `-I/~luzer/my-archive', only it handles redirections in a more
-     intelligent fashion.

-Following FTP Links
-===================
-
-   The rules for FTP are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for them
-to be.  FTP links in HTML documents are often included for purposes of
-reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them by default.
-
-   To have FTP links followed from HTML documents, you need to specify
-the `--follow-ftp' option.  Having done that, FTP links will span hosts
-regardless of `-H' setting.  This is logical, as FTP links rarely point
-to the same host where the HTTP server resides.  For similar reasons,
-the `-L' options has no effect on such downloads.  On the other hand,
-domain acceptance (`-D') and suffix rules (`-A' and `-R') apply
-normally.
-
-   Also note that followed links to FTP directories will not be
-retrieved recursively further.

-
-Time-Stamping
-*************
-
-   One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
-Internet is updating your archives.
-
-   Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
-changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
-and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
-offer the option of incremental updating.
-
-   Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
-search of "new" files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in the
-place of the old ones.
-
-   A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:
-
-  1. A file of that name does not already exist locally.
-
-  2. A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified
-     more recently than the local file.
-
-   To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
-modification of both remote and local files.  Such information are
-called the "time-stamps".
-
-   The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using `--timestamping'
-(`-N') option, or through `timestamping = on' directive in `.wgetrc'.
-With this option, for each file it intends to download, Wget will check
-whether a local file of the same name exists.  If it does, and the
-remote file is older, Wget will not download it.
-
-   If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
-match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
-say.

-
-Time-Stamping Usage
-===================
-
-   The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to
-download a file so that it keeps its date of modification.
-
-     wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
-
-   A simple `ls -l' shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
-the state of the `Last-Modified' header, as returned by the server.  As
-you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even without
-`-N'.
-
-   Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file
-has changed, and download it if it has.
-
-     wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
-
-   Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local
-file is newer, the remote file will not be re-fetched.  However, if the
-remote file is more recent, Wget will proceed fetching it normally.
-
-   The same goes for FTP.  For example:
-
-     wget ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*
-
-   `ls' will show that the timestamps are set according to the state on
-the remote server.  Reissuing the command with `-N' will make Wget
-re-fetch _only_ the files that have been modified.
-
-   In both HTTP and FTP retrieval Wget will time-stamp the local file
-correctly (with or without `-N') if it gets the stamps, i.e. gets the
-directory listing for FTP or the `Last-Modified' header for HTTP.
-
-   If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use the
-following command every week:
-
-     wget --timestamping -r ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/

-
-HTTP Time-Stamping Internals
-============================
-
-   Time-stamping in HTTP is implemented by checking of the
-`Last-Modified' header.  If you wish to retrieve the file `foo.html'
-through HTTP, Wget will check whether `foo.html' exists locally.  If it
-doesn't, `foo.html' will be retrieved unconditionally.
-
-   If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
-time-stamp (similar to the way `ls -l' checks it), and then send a
-`HEAD' request to the remote server, demanding the information on the
-remote file.
-
-   The `Last-Modified' header is examined to find which file was
-modified more recently (which makes it "newer").  If the remote file is
-newer, it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give up.(1)
-
-   When `--backup-converted' (`-K') is specified in conjunction with
-`-N', server file `X' is compared to local file `X.orig', if extant,
-rather than being compared to local file `X', which will always differ
-if it's been converted by `--convert-links' (`-k').
-
-   Arguably, HTTP time-stamping should be implemented using the
-`If-Modified-Since' request.
-
-   ---------- Footnotes ----------
-
-   (1) As an additional check, Wget will look at the `Content-Length'
-header, and compare the sizes; if they are not the same, the remote
-file will be downloaded no matter what the time-stamp says.
-

-File: wget.info,  Node: FTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Prev: HTTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Up: Time-Stamping
-
-FTP Time-Stamping Internals
-===========================
-
-   In theory, FTP time-stamping works much the same as HTTP, only FTP
-has no headers--time-stamps must be received from the directory
-listings.
-
-   For each directory files must be retrieved from, Wget will use the
-`LIST' command to get the listing.  It will try to analyze the listing,
-assuming that it is a Unix `ls -l' listing, and extract the
-time-stamps.  The rest is exactly the same as for HTTP.
-
-   Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
-sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
-non-Unix FTP servers use the Unixoid listing format because most (all?)
-of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that RFC959 defines no
-standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps.  We can
-only hope that a future standard will define this.
-
-   Another non-standard solution includes the use of `MDTM' command
-that is supported by some FTP servers (including the popular
-`wu-ftpd'), which returns the exact time of the specified file.  Wget
-may support this command in the future.

-Startup File
-************
-
-   Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
-line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent.
-You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
-file--`.wgetrc'.
-
-   Besides `.wgetrc' is the "main" initialization file, it is
-convenient to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget
-reads and interprets the contents of `$HOME/.netrc', if it finds it.
-You can find `.netrc' format in your system manuals.
-
-   Wget reads `.wgetrc' upon startup, recognizing a limited set of
-commands.

-
-Wgetrc Location
-===============
-
-   When initializing, Wget will look for a "global" startup file,
-`/usr/local/etc/wgetrc' by default (or some prefix other than
-`/usr/local', if Wget was not installed there) and read commands from
-there, if it exists.
-
-   Then it will look for the user's file.  If the environmental variable
-`WGETRC' is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
-further attempts will be made.
-
-   If `WGETRC' is not set, Wget will try to load `$HOME/.wgetrc'.
-
-   The fact that user's settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
-means that in case of collision user's wgetrc _overrides_ the
-system-wide wgetrc (in `/usr/local/etc/wgetrc' by default).  Fascist
-admins, away!

-
-Wgetrc Syntax
-=============
-
-   The syntax of a wgetrc command is simple:
-
-     variable = value
-
-   The "variable" will also be called "command".  Valid "values" are
-different for different commands.
-
-   The commands are case-insensitive and underscore-insensitive.  Thus
-`DIr__PrefiX' is the same as `dirprefix'.  Empty lines, lines beginning
-with `#' and lines containing white-space only are discarded.
-
-   Commands that expect a comma-separated list will clear the list on an
-empty command.  So, if you wish to reset the rejection list specified in
-global `wgetrc', you can do it with:
-
-     reject =

-
-Wgetrc Commands
-===============
-
-   The complete set of commands is listed below.  Legal values are
-listed after the `='.  Simple Boolean values can be set or unset using
-`on' and `off' or `1' and `0'.  A fancier kind of Boolean allowed in
-some cases is the "lockable" Boolean, which may be set to `on', `off',
-`always', or `never'.  If an option is set to `always' or `never', that
-value will be locked in for the duration of the wget invocation -
-commandline options will not override.
-
-   Some commands take pseudo-arbitrary values.  ADDRESS values can be
-hostnames or dotted-quad IP addresses.  N can be any positive integer,
-or `inf' for infinity, where appropriate.  STRING values can be any
-non-empty string.
-
-   Most of these commands have commandline equivalents (*note
-Invoking::), though some of the more obscure or rarely used ones do not.
-
-accept/reject = STRING
-     Same as `-A'/`-R' (*note Types of Files::).
-
-add_hostdir = on/off
-     Enable/disable host-prefixed file names.  `-nH' disables it.
-
-continue = on/off
-     Enable/disable continuation of the retrieval - the same as `-c'
-     (which enables it).
-
-background = on/off
-     Enable/disable going to background - the same as `-b' (which
-     enables it).
-
-backup_converted = on/off
-     Enable/disable saving pre-converted files with the suffix `.orig'
-     - the same as `-K' (which enables it).
-
-base = STRING
-     Consider relative URLs in URL input files forced to be interpreted
-     as HTML as being relative to STRING - the same as `-B'.
-
-bind_address = ADDRESS
-     Bind to ADDRESS, like the `--bind-address' option.
-
-cache = on/off
-     When set to off, disallow server-caching.  See the `-C' option.
-
-convert links = on/off
-     Convert non-relative links locally.  The same as `-k'.
-
-cut_dirs = N
-     Ignore N remote directory components.
-
-debug = on/off
-     Debug mode, same as `-d'.
-
-delete_after = on/off
-     Delete after download - the same as `--delete-after'.
-
-dir_prefix = STRING
-     Top of directory tree - the same as `-P'.
-
-dirstruct = on/off
-     Turning dirstruct on or off - the same as `-x' or `-nd',
-     respectively.
-
-domains = STRING
-     Same as `-D' (*note Domain Acceptance::).
-
-dot_bytes = N
-     Specify the number of bytes "contained" in a dot, as seen
-     throughout the retrieval (1024 by default).  You can postfix the
-     value with `k' or `m', representing kilobytes and megabytes,
-     respectively.  With dot settings you can tailor the dot retrieval
-     to suit your needs, or you can use the predefined "styles" (*note

-
-quiet = on/off
-     Quiet mode - the same as `-q'.
-
-quota = QUOTA
-     Specify the download quota, which is useful to put in the global

-     to off is the same as `-nr'.
-
-retr_symlinks = on/off
-     When set to on, retrieve symbolic links as if they were plain
-     files; the same as `--retr-symlinks'.
-

-
-   The examples are classified into three sections, because of clarity.
-The first section is a tutorial for beginners.  The second section
-explains some of the more complex program features.  The third section
-contains advice for mirror administrators, as well as even more complex
-features (that some would call perverted).

-
-File: wget.info,  Node: Simple Usage,  Next: Advanced Usage,  Prev: Examples,  Up: Examples
-
-Simple Usage
-============
-
-   * Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:
-
-          wget http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
-
-     The response will be something like:
-
-          --13:30:45--  http://fly.srk.fer.hr:80/en/
-                     => `index.html'
-          Connecting to fly.srk.fer.hr:80... connected!
-          HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
-          Length: 4,694 [text/html]
-          
-              0K -> ....                                                   [100%]
-          
-          13:30:46 (23.75 KB/s) - `index.html' saved [4694/4694]
-
-   * But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is
-     lengthy?  The connection will probably fail before the whole file
-     is retrieved, more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting
-     the file until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the
-     default number of retries (this being 20).  It is easy to change
-     the number of tries to 45, to insure that the whole file will
-     arrive safely:
-
-          wget --tries=45 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg
-
-   * Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its
-     progress to log file `log'.  It is tiring to type `--tries', so we
-     shall use `-t'.
-
-          wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &
-
-     The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in
-     the background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use `-t inf'.
-
-   * The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
-     password.
-
-          $ wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/welcome.msg
-          --10:08:47--  ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr:21/welcome.msg
-                     => `welcome.msg'
-          Connecting to gnjilux.srk.fer.hr:21... connected!
-          Logging in as anonymous ... Logged in!
-          ==> TYPE I ... done.  ==> CWD not needed.
-          ==> PORT ... done.    ==> RETR welcome.msg ... done.
-          Length: 1,340 (unauthoritative)
-          
-              0K -> .                                                      [100%]
-          
-          10:08:48 (1.28 MB/s) - `welcome.msg' saved [1340]
-
-   * If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory
-     listing, parse it and convert it to HTML.  Try:
-
-          wget ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
-          lynx index.html
-

-Advanced Usage
-==============
-
-   * You would like to read the list of URLs from a file?  Not a problem
-     with that:
-
-          wget -i file
-
-     If you specify `-' as file name, the URLs will be read from
-     standard input.
-
-   * Create a mirror image of GNU WWW site (with the same directory
-     structure the original has) with only one try per document, saving
-     the log of the activities to `gnulog':
-
-          wget -r -t1 http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ -o gnulog
-
-   * Retrieve the first layer of yahoo links:
-
-          wget -r -l1 http://www.yahoo.com/
-
-   * Retrieve the index.html of `www.lycos.com', showing the original
-     server headers:
-
-          wget -S http://www.lycos.com/
-
-   * Save the server headers with the file:
-          wget -s http://www.lycos.com/
-          more index.html
-
-   * Retrieve the first two levels of `wuarchive.wustl.edu', saving them
-     to /tmp.
-
-          wget -P/tmp -l2 ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/
-
-   * You want to download all the GIFs from an HTTP directory.  `wget
-     http://host/dir/*.gif' doesn't work, since HTTP retrieval does not
-     support globbing.  In that case, use:
-
-          wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://host/dir/
-
-     It is a bit of a kludge, but it works.  `-r -l1' means to retrieve
-     recursively (*note Recursive Retrieval::), with maximum depth of 1.
-     `--no-parent' means that references to the parent directory are
-     ignored (*note Directory-Based Limits::), and `-A.gif' means to
-     download only the GIF files.  `-A "*.gif"' would have worked too.
-
-   * Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
-     interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already
-     present.  It would be:
-
-          wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
-
-   * If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or
-     FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (*note URL Format::).
-
-          wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@jagor.srce.hr/.emacs
-
-   * If you do not like the default retrieval visualization (1K dots
-     with 10 dots per cluster and 50 dots per line), you can customize
-     it through dot settings (*note Wgetrc Commands::).  For example,
-     many people like the "binary" style of retrieval, with 8K dots and
-     512K lines:
-
-          wget --dot-style=binary ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/README
-
-     You can experiment with other styles, like:
-
-          wget --dot-style=mega ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/xemacs-20.4/xemacs-20.4.tar.gz
-          wget --dot-style=micro http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
-
-     To make these settings permanent, put them in your `.wgetrc', as
-     described before (*note Sample Wgetrc::).

-Guru Usage
-==========
-
-   * If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
-     subdirectories), use `--mirror' (`-m'), which is the shorthand for
-     `-r -N'.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to
-     recheck a site each Sunday:
-
-          crontab
-          0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ -o /home/me/weeklog
-
-   * You may wish to do the same with someone's home page.  But you do
-     not want to download all those images--you're only interested in
-     HTML.
-
-          wget --mirror -A.html http://www.w3.org/
-
-   * But what about mirroring the hosts networkologically close to you?
-     It seems so awfully slow because of all that DNS resolving.  Just
-     use `-D' (*note Domain Acceptance::).
-
-          wget -rN -Dsrce.hr http://www.srce.hr/
-
-     Now Wget will correctly find out that `regoc.srce.hr' is the same
-     as `www.srce.hr', but will not even take into consideration the
-     link to `www.mit.edu'.
-
-   * You have a presentation and would like the dumb absolute links to
-     be converted to relative?  Use `-k':
-
-          wget -k -r URL
-
-   * You would like the output documents to go to standard output
-     instead of to files?  OK, but Wget will automatically shut up
-     (turn on `--quiet') to prevent mixing of Wget output and the
-     retrieved documents.
-
-          wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/
-
-     You can also combine the two options and make weird pipelines to
-     retrieve the documents from remote hotlists:
-
-          wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -

-Proxies
-=======
-
-   "Proxies" are special-purpose HTTP servers designed to transfer data
-from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies is
-lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
-achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the proxy
-which caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is requested
-again, proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for proxies
-is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their internal
-networks from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain information
-from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data using an
-authorized proxy.
-
-   Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The
-standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using
-the following environment variables:
-
-`http_proxy'
-     This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
-     connections.
-
-`ftp_proxy'
-     This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
-     connections.  It is quite common that HTTP_PROXY and FTP_PROXY are
-     set to the same URL.
-
-`no_proxy'
-     This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain
-     extensions proxy should _not_ be used for.  For instance, if the
-     value of `no_proxy' is `.mit.edu', proxy will not be used to
-     retrieve documents from MIT.
-
-   In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
-may be specified from within Wget itself.
-
-`-Y on/off'
-`--proxy=on/off'
-`proxy = on/off'
-     This option may be used to turn the proxy support on or off.  Proxy
-     support is on by default, provided that the appropriate environment
-     variables are set.
-
-`http_proxy = URL'
-`ftp_proxy = URL'
-`no_proxy = STRING'
-     These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy
-     settings specified by the environment.
-
-   Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.
-The authorization consists of "username" and "password", which must be
-sent by Wget.  As with HTTP authorization, several authentication
-schemes exist.  For proxy authorization only the `Basic' authentication
-scheme is currently implemented.
-
-   You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
-URL or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the company's
-proxy is located at `proxy.srce.hr' at port 8001, a proxy URL location
-containing authorization data might look like this:
-
-     http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/
-
-   Alternatively, you may use the `proxy-user' and `proxy-password'
-options, and the equivalent `.wgetrc' settings `proxy_user' and
-`proxy_passwd' to set the proxy username and password.

-
-Reporting Bugs
-==============
-
-   You are welcome to send bug reports about GNU Wget to
-<bug-wget@gnu.org>.  The bugs that you think are of the interest to the
-public (i.e. more people should be informed about them) can be Cc-ed to
-the mailing list at <wget@sunsite.auc.dk>.
-
-   Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
-simple guidelines.
-
-  1. Please try to ascertain that the behaviour you see really is a
-     bug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as
-     documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not
-     sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a
-     bug.
-
-  2. Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.
-     E.g. if Wget crashes on `wget -rLl0 -t5 -Y0 http://yoyodyne.com -o
-     /tmp/log', you should try to see if it will crash with a simpler
-     set of options.
-
-     Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of
-     your `.wgetrc' file, just dumping it into the debug message is
-     probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the
-     bug repeats with `.wgetrc' moved out of the way.  Only if it turns
-     out that `.wgetrc' settings affect the bug, should you mail me the
-     relevant parts of the file.
-
-  3. Please start Wget with `-d' option and send the log (or the
-     relevant parts of it).  If Wget was compiled without debug support,
-     recompile it.  It is _much_ easier to trace bugs with debug support
-     on.
-
-  4. If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. `gdb `which
-     wget` core' and type `where' to get the backtrace.
-
-  5. Find where the bug is, fix it and send me the patches. :-)

-Portability
-===========
-
-   Since Wget uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and avoids
-using "special" ultra-mega-cool features of any particular Unix, it
-should compile (and work) on all common Unix flavors.
-
-   Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds
-of Unix systems, including Solaris, Linux, SunOS, OSF (aka Digital
-Unix), Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, and others; refer to the file `MACHINES' in
-the distribution directory for a comprehensive list.  If you compile it
-on an architecture not listed there, please let me know so I can update
-it.
-
-   Wget should also compile on the other Unix systems, not listed in
-`MACHINES'.  If it doesn't, please let me know.
-
-   Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works
-on Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms.  It has been compiled
-successfully using MS Visual C++ 4.0, Watcom, and Borland C compilers,
-with Winsock as networking software.  Naturally, it is crippled of some
-features available on Unix, but it should work as a substitute for
-people stuck with Windows.  Note that the Windows port is *neither
-tested nor maintained* by me--all questions and problems should be
-reported to Wget mailing list at <wget@sunsite.auc.dk> where the
-maintainers will look at them.

-Signals
-=======
-
-   Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
-signal (`SIGHUP') and ignores it.  If the output was on standard
-output, it will be redirected to a file named `wget-log'.  Otherwise,
-`SIGHUP' is ignored.  This is convenient when you wish to redirect the
-output of Wget after having started it.
-
-     $ wget http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/gnus.tar.gz &
-     $ kill -HUP %%     # Redirect the output to wget-log
-
-   Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any
-way. `C-c', `kill -TERM' and `kill -KILL' should kill it alike.

-Robots
-======
-
-   It is extremely easy to make Wget wander aimlessly around a web site,
-sucking all the available data in progress.  `wget -r SITE', and you're
-set.  Great?  Not for the server admin.
-
-   While Wget is retrieving static pages, there's not much of a problem.
-But for Wget, there is no real difference between the smallest static
-page and the hardest, most demanding CGI or dynamic page.  For instance,
-a site I know has a section handled by an, uh, bitchin' CGI script that
-converts all the Info files to HTML.  The script can and does bring the
-machine to its knees without providing anything useful to the
-downloader.
-
-   For such and similar cases various robot exclusion schemes have been
-devised as a means for the server administrators and document authors to
-protect chosen portions of their sites from the wandering of robots.
-
-   The more popular mechanism is the "Robots Exclusion Standard"
-written by Martijn Koster et al. in 1994.  It is specified by placing a
-file named `/robots.txt' in the server root, which the robots are
-supposed to download and parse.  Wget supports this specification.
-
-   Norobots support is turned on only when retrieving recursively, and
-_never_ for the first page.  Thus, you may issue:
-
-     wget -r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
-
-   First the index of fly.srk.fer.hr will be downloaded.  If Wget finds
-anything worth downloading on the same host, only _then_ will it load
-the robots, and decide whether or not to load the links after all.
-`/robots.txt' is loaded only once per host.
-
-   Note that the exlusion standard discussed here has undergone some
-revisions.  However, but Wget supports only the first version of RES,
-the one written by Martijn Koster in 1994, available at
-<http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots.html>.  A
-later version exists in the form of an internet draft
-<draft-koster-robots-00.txt> titled "A Method for Web Robots Control",
-which expired on June 4, 1997.  I am not aware if it ever made to an
-RFC.  The text of the draft is available at
-<http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots-rfc.html>.
-Wget does not yet support the new directives specified by this draft,
-but we plan to add them.
-
-   This manual no longer includes the text of the old standard.
-
-   The second, less known mechanism, enables the author of an individual
-document to specify whether they want the links from the file to be
-followed by a robot.  This is achieved using the `META' tag, like this:
-
-     <meta name="robots" content="nofollow">
-
-   This is explained in some detail at
-<http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/meta-user.html>.
-Unfortunately, Wget does not support this method of robot exclusion yet,
-but it will be implemented in the next release.

-Security Considerations
-=======================
-
-   When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted
-passwords through the network, which may present a security problem.
-Here are the main issues, and some solutions.
-
-  1. The passwords on the command line are visible using `ps'.  If this
-     is a problem, avoid putting passwords from the command line--e.g.
-     you can use `.netrc' for this.
-
-  2. Using the insecure "basic" authentication scheme, unencrypted
-     passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.
-
-  3. The FTP passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
-     solution for this at the moment.
-
-  4. Although the "normal" output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
-     debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
-     being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send
-     them to me).

-GNU General Public License
-==========================
-
-                         Version 2, June 1991
-
-     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
-     
-     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-Preamble
-========
-
-   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
-new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
-and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
-     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
-     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
-     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
-     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
-     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
-     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
-     licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
-     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
-     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
-     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
-     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
-     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
-     this License along with the Program.
-
-     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
-     for a fee.
-
-  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
-          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
-          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
-          to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
-          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
-          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
-          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
-          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
-          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
-          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
-          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
-          to print an announcement.)
-
-     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
-     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
-     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
-     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
-     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
-     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
-     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
-     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
-     and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
-     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
-     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
-     derivative or collective works based on the Program.
-
-     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
-     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
-     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
-     other work under the scope of this License.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
-     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
-     following:
-
-       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
-          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
-          software interchange; or,
-
-       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-          received the program in object code or executable form with
-          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
-     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
-     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
-     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
-     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
-     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
-     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
-     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
-     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
-     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
-     from you under this License will not have their licenses
-     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
-     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
-     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
-     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
-     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
-     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
-     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
-
-  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
-     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
-     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
-     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
-     by third parties to this License.
-
-  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
-     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
-     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
-     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
-     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
-     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
-     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
-     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
-     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
-     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
-     entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
-     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
-     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
-     in other circumstances.
-
-     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
-     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
-     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
-     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
-     licensee cannot impose that choice.
-
-     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
-     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
-     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
-     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
-     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
-     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
-     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
-     this License.
-
- 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
-     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
-     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
-     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
-     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
-     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
-     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
-     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
-     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
- 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
-     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
-     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
-     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision

-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-=============================================
-
-   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
-terms.
-
-   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
-     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
-     
-     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
-     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
-     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-     
-     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-     GNU General Public License for more details.
-     
-     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
-
-   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
-mail.
-
-   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
-this when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
-     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
-     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
-     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
-     for details.
-
-   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
-appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
-commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
-c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
-program.
-
-   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
-your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
-if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
-     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
-     (which makes passes at compilers) written
-     by James Hacker.
-     
-     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
-     Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
-program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
-library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
-applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
-GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

-==============================
-
-                        Version 1.1, March 2000
-
-     Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-     
-     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-
-
-  0. PREAMBLE
-
-     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
-     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
-     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
-     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
-     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
-     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
-     modifications made by others.
-
-     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
-     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
-     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
-     license designed for free software.
-
-     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
-     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
-     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
-     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
-     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
-     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
-     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
-     instruction or reference.
-
-
-  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
-
-     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
-     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
-     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
-     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
-     and is addressed as "you".
-
-     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
-     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
-     modifications and/or translated into another language.
-
-     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
-     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
-     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
-     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
-     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
-     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
-     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
-     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
-     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
-     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
-
-     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
-     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
-     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
-     License.
-
-     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
-     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
-     that says that the Document is released under this License.
-
-     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
-     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
-     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
-     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
-     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
-     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
-     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
-     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
-     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
-     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
-     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
-
-     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
-     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
-     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
-     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
-     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
-     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
-     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
-     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
-     processors for output purposes only.
-
-     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
-     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
-     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
-     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
-     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
-     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
-
-
-  2. VERBATIM COPYING
-
-     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
-     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
-     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
-     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
-     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
-     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
-     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
-     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
-     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
-     the conditions in section 3.
-
-     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
-     and you may publicly display copies.
-
-
-  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
-
-     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
-     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
-     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
-     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
-     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
-     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
-     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
-     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
-     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
-     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
-     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
-     other respects.
-
-     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
-     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
-     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
-     adjacent pages.
-
-     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
-     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
-     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
-     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
-     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
-     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
-     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
-     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
-     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
-     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
-     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
-     location until at least one year after the last time you
-     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
-     retailers) of that edition to the public.
-
-     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
-     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
-     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
-     version of the Document.
-
-
-  4. MODIFICATIONS
-
-     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
-     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
-     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
-     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
-     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
-     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
-     things in the Modified Version:
-
-     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
-     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
-     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
-     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
-     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
-     gives permission.
-     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
-     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
-     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
-     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
-     has less than five).
-     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
-     Modified Version, as the publisher.
-     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
-     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
-     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
-     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
-     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
-     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
-     Addendum below.
-     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
-     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
-     license notice.
-     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
-     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
-     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
-       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
-     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
-     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
-     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
-     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
-     sentence.
-     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
-       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
-     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
-     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
-     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
-     that was published at    least four years before the Document
-     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
-     to gives permission.
-     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
-     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
-      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
-     and/or dedications given therein.
-     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
-     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
-     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
-     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
-     may not be included in the Modified Version.
-     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
-     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
-
-     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
-     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
-     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
-     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
-     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
-     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
-     other section titles.
-
-     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
-     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
-     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
-     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
-     of a standard.
-
-     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
-     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
-     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
-     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
-     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
-     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
-     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
-     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
-     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
-     publisher that added the old one.
-
-     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
-     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
-     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
-
-
-  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
-
-     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
-     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
-     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
-     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
-     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
-     combined work in its license notice.
-
-     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
-     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
-     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
-     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
-     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
-     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
-     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
-     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
-     combined work.
-
-     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
-     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
-     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
-     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
-     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
-
-
-  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
-
-     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
-     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
-     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
-     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
-     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
-     documents in all other respects.
-
-     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
-     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
-     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
-     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
-     that document.
-
-
-  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
-
-     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
-     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
-     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
-     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
-     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
-     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
-     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
-     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
-     derivative works of the Document.
-
-     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
-     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
-     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
-     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
-     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
-     aggregate.
-
-
-  8. TRANSLATION
-
-     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
-     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
-     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
-     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
-     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
-     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
-     translation of this License provided that you also include the
-     original English version of this License.  In case of a
-     disagreement between the translation and the original English
-     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.
-
-
-  9. TERMINATION
-
-     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
-     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
-     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
-     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
-     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
-     from you under this License will not have their licenses
-     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-
- 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
-
-     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
-     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
-     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
-     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
-     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
-
-     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
-     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
-     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
-     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
-     that specified version or of any later version that has been
-     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
-     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
-     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
-     Free Software Foundation.
-
-
-ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
-====================================================
-
-   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
-the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
-notices just after the title page:
-
-
-       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
-       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
-       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
-       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
-       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
-       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
-       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
-       Free Documentation License''.
-If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
-Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
-Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover
-Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
-
-   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
-recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
-free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
-permit their use in free software.
