 	- Added configure check for libbind.a.  If found, it will be

+	  requests, such as for peer digests.  These requests are
+	  known to fwdStart() because the address arg is set to
+	  'no_addr'.
 	- Completed initial HTCP implementation.  It works, but is not
 	  tested much.
 	- Added counters for I/O syscalls.
 	- Fixed httpMaybeRemovePublic.  With broken ICP neighbors
 	  (netapp) Squid doesn't use private keys.  This caused us
 	  to remove almost every object from the cache.
 	- Added 'asndb' cachemgr stats to show AS Number tree.
+	- Fixed AS Number byte-order bug for netmasks.
 	- Fixed comm_incoming calling rate for high loads (Stewart
 	  Forster).
 	- Give always_direct higher precedence than never_direct
 	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
-	- experimental attempt to fix "peer disappeared" coredumps
+	- Changed PORT ACL type to accept ranges.  Now you can easily
+	   deny, for example, all priveleged ports except 80, 70, 21,
+	   etc.
+	- ARP ACL fixes for Linux (David Luyer).
+	- Replaced various "EBIT" flags bitfileds with structures of
+	  "int:1" members.
+	- Changed storeKeyPrivate and storeKeyPublic to be a bit more
+	  efficient by removing snprintf().  This causes an
+	  incompatibility with old cache keys, however.  To transition,
+	  we will look up both the new and old style keys for about the
+	  next 30 days.  After that, if you haven't run this (or a
+	  future) version, your cache contents will be lost.
+	- Made the client-side write buffer size configurable with
+	  a #define in defines.h.  By default it is still 4096 bytes.
+	- Removed redirectUnregister().  It should be unnecessary
+	  because of cbdata locks.
+	- Fixed multiple HEAD request brokennesses (Henrik Nordstrom).
+	- Changed non-blocking connect(2) code to call getsockopt()
+	  instead of connect() again.  This is the approach recommended
+	  by Stevens, and fixes bugs on BSD-ish systems when subsequent
+	  connect() calls loop with EAGAIN status.
+	- Added MD5 cache keys to memory pool accounting.
+	- Added code to track number of open DISK descriptors and stop
+	  swapping out objects if the number of disk descriptors becomes
+	  too large.  For now the limit must be manually configured with
+	  the 'max_open_disk_fds'.  By default, there is no limit.
+	- Stopped encoding a request method in the high byte of the ICP
+	  reqnum field.  Instead queried cache keys are copied to a
+	  static array, indexed by the reqnum, modulo the array size.
+	  Now we just use the request number to lookup a cache key,
+	  instead of rebuilding it from the ICP reply URL and method,
+	  unless we have netapp neighbors--they don't do reqnum
+	  properly.
+	- Fixed reconfigure memory access bugs in redirect.c.
