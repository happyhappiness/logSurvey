+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11([ext|noext],[mandatory|optional])
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   Check for baseline language coverage in the compiler for the C++11
+#   standard; if necessary, add switches to CXXFLAGS to enable support.
+#
+#   The first argument, if specified, indicates whether you insist on an
+#   extended mode (e.g. -std=gnu++11) or a strict conformance mode (e.g.
+#   -std=c++11).  If neither is specified, you get whatever works, with
+#   preference for an extended mode.
+#
+#   The second argument, if specified 'mandatory' or if left unspecified,
+#   indicates that baseline C++11 support is required and that the macro
+#   should error out if no mode with that support is found.  If specified
+#   'optional', then configuration proceeds regardless, after defining
+#   HAVE_CXX11 if and only if a supporting mode is found.

+
+<P>Details at 
+<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreID">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreID</A>.</P>
+
+<P>This feature is a redesigned equivalent to the Squid-2.7 feature known as StoreURL-rewrite.</P>
+
+<P><EM>Notice</EM> that this is not a direct portage of the Squid-2.7 feature so behaviour
+differences do exist. Although the new feature works in similar enough ways that the old
+helper scripts used for Squid-2.7 are expected to work in this and later versions of Squid.</P>
+
+<P>Squid traditionally uses the requested URL as an index key ID to locate objects in cache.
+It is not the only key possible and the Store-ID feature exposes an API for external
+helpers to provide Squid with an alternative key name for any URL.</P>
+
+<P>When any client request is received which requires a cache lookup the URL is passed to
+a helper specified with the <EM>store_id_program</EM> directive to check for an alternative
+Store ID. This allows the helper to identify URLs which refer to duplicate resources and
+de-duplicate the cache content. <EM>store_id_access</EM> is provided to allow ACL-based
+tuning of which traffic gets sent to the helper and reduce overheads.</P>
+
+<P>One subtle and noteworthy difference between Squid-2 and Squid-3 which is highlighted by
+this feature is that <EM>refresh_pattern</EM> applies its regex argument against the Store
+ID key and not the transaction URL. So using the Store-ID feature to alter the value
+affects which <EM>refresh_pattern</EM> directive will be matched.</P>
+
+<P>Store-ID helpers bundled with Squid can be built with the --enable-storeid-rewrite-helpers
+options which is added in this version. Currently there is a <EM>file</EM> helper
+provided.</P>
+
+
+<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="#toc2.4">TPROXY Support for OpenBSD 5.1+ and FreeBSD 9+</A>
+</H2>
+
+<P>Details at 
+<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/OpenBsdPf">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/OpenBsdPf</A>.</P>
+
+<P>The Packet Filter (PF) firewall in OpenBSD 4.4 and later offers traffic interception
+using several very simple methods. One of which is the <EM>divert-to</EM> rule type
+which acts as a simple routing diversion instead of performing NAT packet alterations.</P>
+
+<P>The IP Firewall (IPFW) on FreeBSD 9+ contains a port of the Linux Netfilter TPROXY feature.</P>
+
+<P>This version of Squid adds support for these features through the ./configure
+options --enable-pf-transparent and --enable-ipfw-transparent when Squid is built on
+systems with the required support. No special extras are required to enable
+<EM>http_port ... tproxy</EM> configuration to work.</P>
+
+<P>NOTE: To resolve NAT lookup issues on recent PF firewall versions the code behind
+<EM>./configure --enable-pf-transparent</EM> has been altered and is expected to
+break on the version of PF firewall shipped with BSD systems such as NetBSD and FreeBSD
+which do not yet support the getsockname() API.
+These systems require <EM>--with-nat-devpf</EM> to enable /dev/pf support when using PF firewall.</P>
+
+
+<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="#toc2.5">Transaction Annotations</A>
+</H2>
+
+<P>Previously the only annotation methods available were ICAP/eCAP HTTP header insertions
+or external ACL <EM>tag=</EM> result code. Each of which had only limited possibilities
+for use and little or no correlation.</P>
+
+<P>It is now possible to add annotations to a client transaction from several sources:
+<UL>
+<LI>    Directly from squid.conf using the <EM>note</EM> directive with
+ACL-based selection of which annotation is linked to any
+particular transaction.
+</LI>
+<LI>    By configured helper processes returning a key=value pair.
+The key name becomes the annotation name.</LI>
+</UL>
+</P>
+
+<P>Annotations on the transaction can be passed to ICAP services or eCAP modules using the
+<EM>adaptation_meta</EM> directive to send them as headers.
+They can also be logged using the <EM>%note</EM> log format code in custom logs. With
+the new helper response syntax changes this means all helper response key=value details
+such as URL-rewrite or store-id changes, external ACL tag etc. are now able to be logged.</P>
+
+<P>Annotations which are already assigned to a transaction can be checked using an ACL test
+of the new <EM>note</EM> ACL type. This can match a particular note by name and value,
+of for any notes with a given name.</P>
+
+<P>NOTE: not all helper interfaces are yet enabled to convert key=value into annotations
+and the external ACL interface does not yet send annotations to the helper.</P>
+
+
+<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="#toc2.6">Multicast DNS</A>
+</H2>
+
+<P>The internal DNS component fof Squid now supports multicast DNS (mDNS) resolution in
+accordance with RFC 6762.</P>
+
+<P>There is no additional or special configuration required. The multicast DNS group IP
+addresses for IPv4 and IPv6 resolving are added to the set of available DNS resolvers
+and used automatically for domain names ending in <EM>.local</EM> before attempting a
+secondary resolution on the configured resolvers. Domains without <EM>.local</EM> are
+resolved using only the configured DNS resolvers.</P>
+
+<P>Statistics for multicast DNS resolution can be found on the <EM>idns</EM> cache manager
+report.</P>

+<sect1>Store-ID
+<p>Details at <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreID">.
+
+<p>This feature is a redesigned equivalent to the Squid-2.7 feature known as StoreURL-rewrite.
+
+<p><em>Notice</em> that this is not a direct portage of the Squid-2.7 feature so behaviour
+  differences do exist. Although the new feature works in similar enough ways that the old
+  helper scripts used for Squid-2.7 are expected to work in this and later versions of Squid.
+
+<p>Squid traditionally uses the requested URL as an index key ID to locate objects in cache.
+   It is not the only key possible and the Store-ID feature exposes an API for external
+   helpers to provide Squid with an alternative key name for any URL.
+
+<p>When any client request is received which requires a cache lookup the URL is passed to
+   a helper specified with the <em>store_id_program</em> directive to check for an alternative
+   Store ID. This allows the helper to identify URLs which refer to duplicate resources and
+   de-duplicate the cache content. <em>store_id_access</em> is provided to allow ACL-based
+   tuning of which traffic gets sent to the helper and reduce overheads.
+
+<p>One subtle and noteworthy difference between Squid-2 and Squid-3 which is highlighted by
+   this feature is that <em>refresh_pattern</em> applies its regex argument against the Store
+   ID key and not the transaction URL. So using the Store-ID feature to alter the value
+   affects which <em>refresh_pattern</em> directive will be matched.
+
+<p>Store-ID helpers bundled with Squid can be built with the --enable-storeid-rewrite-helpers
+   option which is added in this version. Currently there is a <em>file</em> helper
+   provided.
+
+
+<sect1>TPROXY Support for OpenBSD 5.1+ and FreeBSD 9+
+<p>Details at <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/OpenBsdPf">.
+
+<p>The Packet Filter (PF) firewall in OpenBSD 4.4 and later offers traffic interception
+   using several very simple methods. One of which is the <em>divert-to</em> rule type
+   which acts as a simple routing diversion instead of performing NAT packet alterations.
+
+<p>The IP Firewall (IPFW) on FreeBSD 9+ contains a port of the Linux Netfilter TPROXY feature.
+
+<p>This version of Squid adds support for these features through the ./configure
+   options --enable-pf-transparent and --enable-ipfw-transparent when Squid is built on
+   systems with the required support. No special extras are required to enable
+   <em>http_port ... tproxy</em> configuration to work.
+
+<p>NOTE: To resolve NAT lookup issues on recent PF firewall versions the code behind
+   <em>./configure --enable-pf-transparent</em> has been altered and is expected to
+   break on the version of PF firewall shipped with BSD systems such as NetBSD and FreeBSD
+   which do not yet support the getsockname() API.
+   These systems require <em>--with-nat-devpf</em> to enable /dev/pf support when using PF firewall.
+
+
+<sect1>Transaction Annotations
+<p>Previously the only annotation methods available were ICAP/eCAP HTTP header insertions
+   or external ACL <em>tag=</em> result code. Each of which had only limited possibilities
+   for use and little or no correlation.
+
+<p>It is now possible to add annotations to a client transaction from several sources:
+<itemize>
+	<item>	Directly from squid.conf using the <em>note</em> directive with
+		ACL-based selection of which annotation is linked to any
+		particular transaction.
+
+	<item>	By configured helper processes returning a key=value pair.
+		The key name becomes the annotation name.
+</itemize>
+
+<p>Annotations on the transaction can be passed to ICAP services or eCAP modules using the
+   <em>adaptation_meta</em> directive to send them as headers.
+   They can also be logged using the <em>%note</em> log format code in custom logs. With
+   the new helper response syntax changes this means all helper response key=value details
+   such as URL-rewrite or store-id changes, external ACL tag etc. are now able to be logged.
+
+<p>Annotations which are already assigned to a transaction can be checked using an ACL test
+   of the new <em>note</em> ACL type. This can match a particular note by name and value,
+   of for any notes with a given name.
+
+<p>NOTE: not all helper interfaces are yet enabled to convert key=value into annotations
+	 and the external ACL interface does not yet send annotations to the helper.
+
+
+<sect1>Multicast DNS
+<p>The internal DNS component of Squid now supports multicast DNS (mDNS) resolution in
+    accordance with RFC 6762.
+
+<p>The <em>dns_multicast_local</em> directive must be set to <em>on</em> to enable this
+   feature.
+
+<p>The multicast DNS group IP addresses for IPv4 and IPv6 resolving are added to the set
+   of available DNS resolvers and used automatically for domain names ending in <em>.local</em>
+   and reverse-DNS lookups before attempting a secondary resolution on the configured
+   resolvers. Domains without <em>.local</em> are resolved using only the configured resolvers.
+
+<p>Statistics for multicast DNS resolution can be found on the <em>idns</em> cache manager
+   report.
+
+<p><em>NOTE</em> that the external DNS helper interface is now deprecated and has been
+  removed from future Squid versions. Any installations still using it for local hostname
+  resolution need to upgrade to mDNS resolution with this Squid version.
+
+
 <sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.3
 <p>
 There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.3.
 
+<p>Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
+   files using the syntax <em>parameters("/path/filename")</em>. For example:
+<verb>
+    acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")
+</verb>
+
+<p>There have also been changes to individual directives in the config file.

+<p>Details at <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/auth_param/">.
+
+<p>The new <em>key_extras</em> parameter allows sending of additional
+  details to the authentication helper beyond the minimum required for
+  the HTTP authentication. This is primarily intended to allow switching
+  of authentication databases based on criteria such as client IP subnet,
+  Squid receiving port, or in reverse-proxy the requested domain name.
+
+<p>In theory any <em>logformat</em> code may be used, however only the
+  codes which have available details at the time of authentication
+  will send any meaningful detail.
+
+
+<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.4
+<p>
+There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.4.
+
+<p>Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
+   files using the syntax <em>parameters("/path/filename")</em>. For example:
+<verb>
+    acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")
+</verb>
+
+<p>There have also been changes to individual directives in the config file.
+
+This section gives a thorough account of those changes in three categories:
