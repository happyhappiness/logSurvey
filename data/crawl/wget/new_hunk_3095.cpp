/* Print NUMBER to a statically allocated string and return a pointer
   to the printed representation.

   This function is intended to be used in conjunction with printf.
   It is hard to portably print wgint values:
    a) you cannot use printf("%ld", number) because wgint can be long
       long on 32-bit machines with LFS.
    b) you cannot use printf("%lld", number) because NUMBER could be
       long on 32-bit machines without LFS, or on 64-bit machines,
       which do not require LFS.  Also, Windows doesn't support %lld.
    c) you cannot use printf("%j", (int_max_t) number) because not all
       versions of printf support "%j", the most notable being the one
       on Windows.
    d) you cannot #define WGINT_FMT to the appropriate format and use
       printf(WGINT_FMT, number) because that would break translations
       for user-visible messages, such as printf("Downloaded: %d
       bytes\n", number).

   What you should use instead is printf("%s", number_to_static_string
   (number)).

   CAVEAT: since the function returns pointers to static data, you
   must be careful to copy its result before calling it again.
   However, to make it more useful with printf, the function maintains
   an internal ring of static buffers to return.  That way things like
   printf("%s %s", number_to_static_string (num1),
   number_to_static_string (num2)) work as expected.  Three buffers
   are currently used, which means that "%s %s %s" will work, but "%s
   %s %s %s" won't.  If you need to print more than three wgints,
   bump the RING_SIZE (or rethink your message.)  */
