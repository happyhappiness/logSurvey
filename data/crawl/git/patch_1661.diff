 Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
 special notations explained in the description, additional commit

-ordering and formatting options, such as '--reverse'.
+limiting may be applied.

+Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
+`--since=<date1>` limits to commits newer than `<date1>`, and using it
+with `--grep=<pattern>` further limits to commits whose log message
+has a line that matches `<pattern>`), unless otherwise noted.
